NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCES 
WERE INADEQUE.  THAT IT WAS 
NECESSARY TO DO SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT.

VOTE WHICH WAS POLITICALLY 
DANGEROUS, FRANKLY.  AT THAT 
POINT IN TIME I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO COME UP WITH 5 OR 6 
PEOPLE THAT WERE GAY IN THE 
ENTIRE KNOWLEDGE.  PEOPLE WERE 
IN THE CLOSET.  WE DIDN'T 
KNOW -- IT JUST WAS A SCARY 
THING AND WE'RE AFRAID THAT WE 
WOULD BE KICD OUT OF OFFICE IF

    BUT STEVE SAID IT WAS THE 
RIGHT THING TO DO.  THAT'S'S WH 
IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO, HUMAN 
RIGHTS.  AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR

HAVE PADE.  -- HAVE PASSED.

SOMEONE NOW DECEASED WHO WAS 
INSTRUMENTAL AS ANYBODY IN THIS 
PROCESS.

CHANGES THE TERMS OF THE

THAT WE -- THAT WE YOU APPROVE

MONTHS WITH AN OPTION FOR

FOR COUNCIL APPROVAL WITH POLICE
CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS.  I'LL 
MOVE APPROVAL OF THIS ITEM.

WE DID DO A LOT OF WORK ON THIS 
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 
EVERYBODY IS CLEAR.  
COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.  COULD 
YOU JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE 
I THINK IT'S JUST UNDERSTANDING 
THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME  
CONFUSION ABOUT IT AT COMMITTEE

>> I'LL CALL ON VICE PRESIDENT 
CHUGHTAI.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
AND THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
PALMISANO.  YOU'RE RIGHT.   THEE
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION AT
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.  SO I 
WANT TO JUST EXPLAIN WHAT IS IN 
FRONT  MEMBERS AND THEN 
PERHAPS CITY ATTORNEY ANDERSON 
CAN ALSO JUMP IN AND ADD 
ANYTHING THAT WAS PERHAPS 
MISSED.  
      THIS IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO 
THE ITEM THAT CAME BEFORE US NOW
A COUPLE MEETINGS AGO.  WHIHICH 
WAS A CONTRACT FOR - FOR 3 
YEARS INSTEAD OF 18 MONTHS AND 
FOR $3 MILLION SO $1 MILLION 
ANNUALLY.  AND IT WAS FOR THE 
PURPOSE OF ASSISTING BOTH THE 
OFFICE OF POLOLICE CONDUCT REVI 
ALONG WITH INTERNAL 
INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE 
MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT IN
CONDUCTING CERTAIN POLICE 
MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS.  
      AT THAT TIME THERE WAS 
SOME LIMITATION ON WHAT TYPES OF
CASES WOULD BE INVESTIGATED OR 
WOULD BE ASSISTED BY WEY -- 
THE LAW FIRM THAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT BRINGING ON HERE.  
        AND SINCE THEN, BECAUSE 
THIS IS -- BECAUSE THIS IS A 
PRETTY SENSITIVE SUBJECT AND THE
WAY OUR MISCONDUCT 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE HANDLED WERE 
THE SUBJECT OF A LOT OF SCRUTINY
AND -- THEY WERE THE SUBJECT OF 
NY PARTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 
COMPLETETED INTO THE CITY OF 
MINNEAPOLIS BY THE MINNESOTA 
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WE 
WERE THEN ABLE TO MEET WITH THE 
MINNEAPOLIS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS ALONGSIDE EAFA WHICH 
IS -- THEY ARE OUR INDEPENDENT 
EVALUATOR THAT MONITOR OUR -- 
OUR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH 
MDHR, WITH THE MINNESOTA 
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
AS A RESULT WERE ABLE TO COME TO
MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THIS 
CONTRACT.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY -- 
WILEY WILL ONLBE ASSISTING 
WITH CASES THAT ARE WITHIN THE 
OFFICE OF POLICE CONDUDUCT REVI 
AND THERE WILL BE A FURTHER 
DISCUSSION ABOUT, AMONG STAFF, 
AND WITH OUR INDEPENDENT 
EVALUATORS, ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS 
LIKE FOR INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS
TO RECEIVE THIS SORT OF SUPPORT 
AND ON WHAT TIME LINE AND 
EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF 
INVESTIGATION -- CASE 
INVESTIGATION SUPPORT THEY NEED.
      WE'VE ALSO SHORTENED THE 
CONTRACT BECAUSE THE SOLE 
PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT IS NOT 
TO HAVE ONGOING SUPPORT 
AROUND -- AROUND ASSISTING -- 
ASSISTANCE WITH MISCONDUCT 
INVESTIGATIONS.  IT IS T CLEAR 
 
THAT I KNOW IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO
ALL OF US HERE SO THAT'S WHERE 
THE S SHORTENING OF THE TIMELIN 
 
KNOW, OUR HOPE IS WITH THIS 
ASSISTANCE THAT WE CERTAINLY 
CLEAR THE BACKLOG IN LESS THAN 3
YEARS BUT REALLY IN THIS 
18-MONTH TIME BUT SHOULD THAT 
NOT HAPPEN THERE'S FLEXIBILITY 
ADDED TO EXTEND THIS TIMELINE.  
      MR. ANDERSON WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING.  
>> SURE, COUNCIL MEMBER 
PRESIDENT, COUNCIL MEMBER 
PALMISANO, I THINK 
COUNCIL MEMBER VICE PRESIDENT 
CHUGHTAI KIND OF ENLAPSE LATED 
IT.  I THINK THAT'S SORT OF 
THE -- ENCAPSULATED IT.  I THINK
THAT'S THE IDEA IN THE MDHR 
SETTMENT AGREEMENT.  IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR MDHR TO HAVE 
INVESTIGATIONS DONE BY IAA 
SEPARATELY FROM INVESTIGATIONS 
BEING DONE BY OPCR SO I T THINK 
THAT THAT WAS LIKE THE BIGGEST 
ISSUE FOR MDHR AND ALEAFA IS 
JUST MAINTAINING THAT SEPARATION
SO -- SO THIS CONTRACT WILL ONLY
BE LIMITED TO CLEARING THE 
BACKLOG FOR OPCR.  IT'S NOT TO 
SAY THAT IA DOESN'T ALSO HAVE A 
BACKLOG AND HAVE NEED OF 
ASSISTANCE AND WE MAY BE GOING 
OUT FOR A SEPARATE RFP FOR THAT 
BUT THAT SEPARATION WAS 
IMPORTANT TO MDHR SO WE 
CONCLUDED THAT AND, YEAH, I'M 
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER
QUESTIONS BUT... 
>> COUNCIL MEMBERR JENKINS?
>> THANK YOU, CHAIR PAYNE.  
      DO WE KNOW THE EXTENT OF 
THE BACKLOG?
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?
>> MISS ANDERSON, WOULD YOU WANT
TO SPEAK TO THAT?
>> COUNCIL PRESIDENT, COUNCILIL 
MEMBERS -- SO I DON'T HAVE 
NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. 
I BELIEVE THE LAST NUMBERS THAT 
ARE RATTLING AROUND IN MY BRAIN 
IS THE BACKLOG FOR OPCR MAYBE IS
IN THE -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 200 
AND 300 CASES BUT I DON'T HAVE 
CURRENT NUMBERS AND MAYBE CASEY 
DOES.  
>> MR.PRESIDENT, I DON'T HAVE 
THE NUMBERS BUT I CAN 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS MEETING 
EMAIL THE INTERIM DIRECTOR OF 
OPCR ON THE POLE OVERSIGHT DID
PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF BACKLOG CASES THAT ARE
EXISTING AS OF T THEIR LAST 
MEETING A FEW WEEKS AGO SO I CAN
SHARE THAT W WITH THE BODY IF 
AT'S OF INTEREST AFTER THE 
MEETING.  
>> SO -- YES, SO STRIKE MY 
REMARKS AND WE'LL GET YOU 
ACCURATE DATA.  
>> MAY I DO A FOLLOW-UP?
>> COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS.  
>> COUIL PRESIDENT, I GUESS DO
WE KNOW HOW -- WHAT'S THE 
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF CASES BEING 
CONCLUDED I A MONTH?
IS THERE A -- IS THAT A PART OF 
THE ANALYSIS, MR. CLERK, DO YOU 
KNOW?
>> MR. PRESIDENT, COUNCIL MEMBER
JENKINS, I'M PULLING UP THROUGH 
LIMS RIGHT NOW THE REPORT THAT 
WAS ISSSSUED BY THE INTERIM 
DIRECTOR OFOPCR AT THEIR LAST 
MEETING SO I WILL IMMEDIATELY 
FORWARD THAT TO YOU.  I CAN'T 
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT THE 
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT.  HAT DETAI 
>> THANK YOU.  I GUESS I'M JUST 
EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT IF WE 
HAD THIS BACKLOG AND NOW WE'RE
SAYING WE CAN COMPLETE IT IN 18 
MONTHS AND JUST WHAT IS THE 
CALCULUS TO GET TO TH NUMBER?
>> VICE PRESIDENT CHUGHTAI?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
      THERE'S A COUPLE OF 
CALCULATIONS THAT WENT INTO 
SHORTENING THE TIME LIONEL.  
ONE, THAT WE REDUCTHE SCOPE OF
THIS CONTRTRACT IN HALF.  SO IT 
MADE SENSE THAT THE TIMELINE -- 
BECAUSE THE SCOPE WAS BEING 
REDUCED BY HALF OF WHAT IT WAS 
PRIOR, THAT THE -- THAT THE 
TIMELINE WOULD SHORTEN AS WELL. 
      SECOND, I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO NOT EQUATE THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES IN BACKLOG
WITH TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES THAT 
WILEY REAPER IS ABLE TO SUPPOPO 
US WITH.  THERE A A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES AROUND 
MISCONDUCT THAT CANNOT BE 
CONTRACTED OUT. E WILL NOT BE 
CONTRACTINGUT IS IT A PART OF 
THIS -- AS A PART OF THI 
CONTRACT AGREEMENT.  SO, LIKE, 
CERTAIN TYPES OF MISCONDUCT 
CASES ARE -- HAVE TO STAY IN 
HOUSE.  SO THERE'S NOT A 
ONE-TO-ONE RATIO WITH THE NUMBER
OF BACKLOG CASES TO THE NUMBER 
THAT WILEY IS SUPPORTING WITH.  
>> T THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
>> MISS ANDERSONID YOU WANT TO
ADD ANY Y CONTEXT.  
>> THANK YO COUNCIL PRESIDENT 
AND COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS, I 
WOULD ADD THERE'S AN OPTION TO 
RENEW, OBVIOUSLYLY, WITH APPROV 
OF COUNCIL SO IF WE GOT TO THAT 
18-MONTH PERIOD OR NEAR THAT 
18-MONTH PERIOD AND REALIZE THAT
WE STILL HAVE A LARGE BACKLOG 
AND NEED THEHE SERVICES STILL,
THEN WE'LL BE CING BACK FOR A 
RENEWAL, YOU KNOW, THE TERMS OF 
THE CONTRACT -- YOU KNOW, THE 
PRICE MAY INCREASE, BUT, YOU 
KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO 
GOTIATE WITH THE VENDOR AT 
THAT POINT BUT -- BUT IT WILL 
ALLOW FOR US TO ASSESS THE NEED 
AT THAT POINT AND -- AND COME 
BACK TO YOU IF NECESSARYRY.  
>> THANK YOU AGAIN.  
>> AND I PUT MYSELF IN QUEUE 
JUST TO ADD ALSO THAT ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE 
ABOUT THIS PATH FORWARD WAS 
ALE
ALEAFA OFFERING UP THEIR 
SERVICES TO HELP REVIEW THOSE 
CASES AS WELL AND HELPING TO 
REFIFINE WHAT THAT PROCESS IS 
GOING TO LOOK LIKE.  SO AS WE 
RAMP UP THIS EXTERNAL 
INVESTIGATOR WE'LL BE RAMPING UP
OUR CAPACITY THROUGH THE 
TECHNICAL CAPACITY OF THAT 
INDEPENDENT PROVIDER.  
>> THANK YOU THAT REALLY HELPS
ME TO BE E ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS 
ITEM TODAY.  
>> THANK YOU.  
>> I SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION 
THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL.  
>> MICROPHONE.  
(ROLL CALL.) 
>> THERE ARE 13 AYESES. 
>> THAT CARRIRIES AND THE REPOR 
IS ADOPTED.  
      THE FINALAL REPORT WILL B 
OFFERED BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND
SAFETY COMMITTEE WHICH WILL BE 
PRESENTED BY THAT COMMITTEE'S 
CHAIR, WHICH IS COUNCIL MEMBER 
CHAVEZ.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY

COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE?E?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
      I JUST WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
A COUPLE COMMENTS ON ITEM NO. 2.
IF I MAY.  I'M GOING TO BE 
VOTING FOR THIS BUT REMAIN 
VERY SKEPTICAL AND I'LL BE 
ANALYZING THIS REPORT.  I'M 
VERY, VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE 
AFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY FOR 
THESEE SAFE RECOVERY SITES.  
      I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE 
GET CALLINGS ALLHE TIME FROM 
COMMUNITY WHO ARE IMPACTED BY 
SUCH OPERATIONS AND, AGAIN, I'M 
A SKEPTIC BUT I'M GOING TO VOTE 
YES FOFOR THIS.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW 
RELEASE -- COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW?
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
PAYNE. I TOO WANT TO SPEAK WITH
ITEM NO. 2.  I SPOKE WITH THE 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH, 
HEIDI RICCI ABOUT THIS ITEM WHEN
IT CAME UP IN COMMITTEE A COUPLE
WEEKS' AGO, BECAUSE WARD 4 HAS 
NOW A SAFE RECOVERY SITE THAT 
WAS LISTED IN THE PAPER AS A 
SAFE USE SITE AND SO THERE'S A 
LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE 
ABOUT WHAT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN 
PASSED AT THE STATE LEVEL IN 
ORDER TO ALLOW FOR FOLKS TO 
SAFELY USE IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
SO I AM -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT 
THIS BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO BE 
WATCHING THIS CLOSING.  
      I FEEL COMFORTABLE -- 
CLOSELY.  I FEELING CLOSELY THAT
OUR ALONG WITH STAFF FROM 
RAMSEY COUNTY TO LOOK AT THE

ITEM ON THE AGENDA TODAY.  
>> THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS.
SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSI,

      WE'LL NEXT TAKE UP THE

ITEM.  THAT IS MOTION BY 
COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS TO 
RECONSIDER ORDINANCE N
NO. 2024-009 RELATED TO MINIMUM 
DRDRIVER COMPENSATION FOR

GAVE NOTICE OF HER INTENT TO 
ING FORWARD THIS MOTION WHICH 
IS ESSENTIALLY A PROPOSAL THAT 
WILL BRING BACK THE TN-C 
COMPENSATION ORDER THAT THE BODY
MIGHT CONSIDER ANY REFINEMENTS 
TO THE PRIOR ACT.  
      AS EVERYONE I AWARE THAT 
ORDINANANCE WAS PASSED OVER THE 
VETO OF THE MAYOR AND SET TO 
BECOME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 1st.  
THE MOTION BEFORE US DOES NOT 
CHANGE THAT FACT.  ABSENT ANY 
ACTION ON OUR PART, THIS 
ORDINANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE 
ON MAY 1st.  THE CLERK HAS 
EPARED A SUMMARY OF THE 
PROCEDURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO
US WITH THIS MOTION TO 
RECONSIDERER IS ADOPTED.  I ASK 
THAT THE CLERK -- THE CLERK 
SUMMARY BE SHARED WITH ALL

OPTION OF THIS MOTION IS 
REQUIRED A MAJORITOF MEMBERS 
THAT ARE PRESENT AND IF IT'S 
ADOPTED THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE 
WILL BE BEFORE US AGAIN AND WE 
MAY CONSIDER FURTHER ACTIONS IF 
ANY AT THAT TIME.  
      THOSE FURTHER ACTIONS 
CANNOT BE CONSIDERED UNLESSHE 
MOTION TO RECONSIDER IS ADOPTED 
FIRST.  
      SO IF THERE ARE ANY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE
I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN THOSE 
FIRST, OTHERWISE, WE WILL 
PROCEED TO THE VOTE ON THE

I'LL GIVE A BRIEF EXPLANATION 
ABOUT OUR PROCEDUS AT THAT 
POINT.  AFTER THIS I'LL ASK IF 
THERE'S ANY FURTHER PROPOSALS ON
THIS ORDINANCE.  FIRST AS I 
ALREADY INDICATED THIS ORDINANCE
WAS ENACTED OVER THE MAYOR'S 
VETO IN MARCH.  IT INCLUDED A 
SESECTION WHICH SET THE EECTIVE 
DAY FOR MAY 1st OF THIS YEAR IN 
ADDITION TO SPECIFIC PAY RATES 
AS COMPENSATION FOR TN-C 
DRIVERS.  THEREFORE, ANY ACTIONS
TODAY AREE PRESENTED AS ORDINANE
TOSS AMEND THE PRIOR ORDINANCE 
HOLLING THIS FEELS DIFFERENT 
AT'S EXACTLY HOW OUR STANDARD 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS.  IN 
OTHER WORDS, WHENEVER WE AMEND 
THE CODE WE DO SO BY ENACT AGNEW
ORDINANCE THAT IDENTIFIES THE 
CHANGES IN THE CODE THAT WE WANT
TO MAKE.  THAT'S ESSENTIALLY 
WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY.  
HOWEVER, AND JUST TO BE VERY 
CLEAR FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS,
ABSENT ANY ACTION ON OUR PART, 
THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE WILL TILL
BECOME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 1st.  
WITH THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER WE
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND 
THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE JUST LIKE
WE WOULD NORMALLY DO AND WE 
AMEND ORDINANCES BY PASSING NEW 
ORDINANCES.  HOWEVER, ONLY OUR 
ACTIONS TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED
TO THE MAYOR.  THAT WOULD NOT 
ORDINANCE TO THE MAYOR.  THAT 
ACTION IS DONE.  
      ILSO HAVE ASKED THE 
CLCLERK TO PROVIDE A OUTLINE OF 
THESE PROCEDURES LAST NIGHT SO I
HOPE YOU YOU HAD A CHANCE TO 
READ THOSE ON WHAT THE POTENTIAL
OPPORTUNITIES ARE.  AT THIS 
POINT I'LL PAUSE AND ASK IF 
THERE'S ANY QUESTIOIONS ABOUT O 
COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO?
>> NO, THAT'S NOT WHERE I WAS IN
QUEUE.  
>> ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR 
PROCEDURE?
I THINK WE ARE READY .
WITH THAT I WILL ASK IF THERE 
ARE ANY AMENDMENTS.  
COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN?
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAIN.  
PAYNE -- PRESIDENT PAYNE. .  YEI
WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A MOTION
TO AMEND.  THE AMENDMENT IS 
BEFORE YOU.  IT'S THE AMENDMENT 
OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 
ORDINANCE MOVING IT FROM MAY 1st
TO JULY 1st.  THIS ANDMENT AND
WITH CONSIDERATION MANY COUNCIL 
MEMBER AND BUSINESS 
STAKEHOLDERS AND STATE 
LEGISLATORS OVER E LAST COUPLE
WEEKS.  NOW WEE PASSED THE MOTIN
TO RECONSIDER THE ORDINANCE THIS
AMENDMENT IS INTENDED TO CREATE 
A MORE REASONABLE TIMELINE FOR 
CONTINUINGUR LEGISLATIVE 
PROCESS.  WHILE TRACKING 
DISCUSSIONS AND ONGOING 
COLLABORATION WITH STATE 
OFFICIALS IN THEIR WORK TO CRAFT
A STATEWIDE POLICY ON THIS 
ISSUE.  
      I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE 
ARE WORKING PROACTIVELY AT THIS 
TIME TOPREVENT POTENTIAL 
DISRUPTION IN RIDE-SHARE SERVICE
WITH A TRANSITION TO NEW 
RIDE-SHARE SERVICE COMPANIES AND
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES USING
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS 
ANDONTINUING TO -- THAT OUR 
DIVERSE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO 
HAVE MOBILITY.  
      S SO WITH THAT, I WILL STD
FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION ON 
THIS AMENDMENT.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN HAS 
MOVED HER AMENDMENT.  I WILL 
CALL ON COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS. 
OH, AND IS THERE A SECOND?
>> SECOND.  
>> OKAY.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
JENKINS?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  I 
JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS 
OF THIS RESOLUTION.  IT GIVES US
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY 
CONTINUE OUR DELIBERATIVE 
PROCESS AS WELL AS FOR VARIOUS 
RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE 
TO AUST TO THE NEWRDINANCE 
AS IT HAS BEEN PASSED BY THIS 
BODY STHANK YOU ALL.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER CHOUDHURY?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
      I WAS REALLY PROUD TO BE 
AN AUTHOR OF THIS AMOUNT.  -- OF
THIS AMENDMENT.  BELIEVE THE 
EXTENSIOION OF OUR IMPLEMENTATI 
DATE IS A REALLY GOOD THING FOR 
US HERE TO ACCOMPLISH THE THINGS
THAT WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH FOR 
THE ORDINANCE THAT IS REALLY 
MEANT TO SUPPORT A FAIR MINIMUM 
WAGE FOR DRIVERS IN THE CITY OF 
MINNEAPOLIS ANDIVE RIDERS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PARTICICIPATI 
IN A RIDE-SHARE ECONOMY THAT IS 
ROOTED IN JUSTICE FOR WORKERS 
AND MOVING FORWARD IN THAT 
DIRECTION.  
      I'LL ECHO THE THINGS THAT 
COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN 
MEIONED.  THIS ALLOWS US AS A 
COUNCIL TO GO THROUGH OUR 
LEGISLATIVE PROCS.  THERE'S 
PIECES OF DISCUSSION THAT ARE 
SL
MEMBERS LIKE MYSELF, I AM 
INTERESTED IN GETTING 
INFORMATION FROM OUR POLICY AND 
RESEARCH TEAM THAT HAS BEEN 
WORKING ON AN ANALYSIS THAT 
CONSIDIDERS THE STATE REPORT.   
MY CAPACITY AS IGR CHAIR, I'VE 
BEEN TALKING CONSISTENTLY WITH 
STATE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ON 
THEIR RESPEPECTIVE LEGISLATIVE 
PROCESS AND THEY HAVE YET TO 
DECIDE KEY COMPONENTS OF THEIR 
BILL AND ARE REALLY LOOKING TO 
US TO WORK ON OUR SIDE AND 
COMPLETE OUR POLICY AS THEY'RE 
COMPLETING THEIR BILL.  
      THEY'RE ASKING THAT THERE 
IS TIME FOR US TO COLLABORATE 
TOGETHER, MO THROUGH OUR 
RESPECTIVE PCESSES AND IT 
MATTERS TO ME AND MANY OF THE 
LEADERS HERE ON OUR CITY COUNCIL
THAT WE ARE ABLE HE TO GO 
THROUGH A CHABTIVE PROCESS -- 
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND REALLY
COME TOGETHER ON A POLICY HERE 
AND IN THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS 
THAT SUPPORTS OUR COMMUNITY AND 
O
THANK OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS
AND OUR MINNEAPOLIS DELEGATION 
IN JOINING US TO COME TO THE 
TABLE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  
      I'LL ALSO NOTOTE AS WE HA 
NOW FOR APPLICATIONS OF NEW 
RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES, THEY'RE IN
THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THOSE 
APPLICATIONS AND GETTINGNG 
LICENSED AND THAT TAKES TIME.  
AND ALSO THERE'S BEEN GREAT 
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN -- 
THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AT THE 
METROPITAN AIRPORT'S 
COMMISSION AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED
THROUGH THAT IS THAT THAT ALSO 
TAKES TIME TO GET LICENSED AND 
I'VE HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS
IN OUR TWIN CITY NEXT DOOR IN 
SG
APPLICATIONS AS WELL.  THEIR 
PRESSES ARERE A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT AND SO I FEEL REALLY 
GOOD ABOUT THIS EXTENSION.  I 
THINK THIS IS POSITIVE AND IT IS
JUST GETTING US TO A GOOD PLACE
OF REALLY COMING TO THE TABLE 
AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL 
THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT I'VE NAMED
BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY THAT'S 
CURRENTLTLY IN THE ROOM TODAY A 
FOLKS THAT ARE TUNING IN AND 
HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO THE 
COUNCIL.  
      SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
CONVERSATION.  
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
CHOUDHURY.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
WONSLEY?
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL P PRESIDE 
PAYNE.  AND ALSO I WANT TO ECHO 
GRATITUDE TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR 
BRINGING THIS FORWARD.  AFTER 
SPEAKING TO DRIVERS WHO HAVE 
BEEN WORKING WITH SEVERAL OF THE
NEW RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES, WHO 
PLAN TO ENTER THE MARKET IN THE 
COMING WEEKS, I FEEL COMFORTABLE
SUPPORTING THIS SOMETHINGS 
     -- THIS EXTENSION.  
      A TWO MONTH EXTENSION WILL
GIVE NEW RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES 
SOME TIME TO GET THEIR 
OPERATIONS IN ORDER AND ALSO 
PROVE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR 
VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO INFORM 
THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEW 
RIDE-SHARE OPTIONS THAT ARE 
COMING TO MINNEAPOLIS.  
      ADDITIONALLY, THIS 
EXTENSION GIVES THE STATE THE 
CHANCE TO FISH OUT THEIR 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND PASS A 
STRONG STATEWIDE POLICY THAT 
GUARANTEES MINIMUM WAGE 
EQUIVALENTS TO THOUSANDS OF 
MINNESOTA DRIVERS THAT PROVIDE 
RIDE-SHARE SERVICES EVERY DAY. 
      THAT SAID, I AM CONFIDENT 
THAT THIS SMALL DELAY IN 
IMPLEMENTATION WILL LEAD TO 
BETTER OUTCOMES FOR DRIVERS AND 
RIDERS STATEWIDE AND ALSO LAY A 
STRONGER FOUNDATION FOR A 
MINNESOTA RIDE-SHSHARE INDUSTRY 
THAT IS MORE EQUITABLE INSTEAD 
OF EXTREMELY EXPLOITIVE WHICH 
RIGHT NOW.  AND THANK YOU TO OUR
COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW?
>> THANK YOU.  I'M GOING TO BE 
SUPPORTING THIS TODAY ALSO BUT 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING 
THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A 
SOLUON.  I'M GOING TO BE 
SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE MY 
COCONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN LIVINGN
FEAR AND ANXIETY OVER THE
UNTOYUN 
CERTAINTY WHETHER THEY'LL HAVE A
JOB GET TO THEIR JOBS OR GET 
THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL.  IN 
THIS WORK WE ALL NEE TO BE 
WILLING TO ADMIT WHEN WE GET 
THINGS WRONG A I THINK THIS IS
JUST A BAD POLICY AND WE NEED TO
GO BACK AND FIX IT.  
      I REALLY HOPE THAT OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS TRE'S 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO F FIX .
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE 
THE COURAGE TO FIX IT BY JULY 
1st.   
      ■I SPOKE TH A COUPLE OF 
THE NEW PROPOSED RIDE-SHARE 
COMPANIES AND ONE IN PARTICULAR 
TOLD ME THAHAT THEY DON'T EVEN 
KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO MEET THE -- THE DEMAND OF HOW
MUCH MINNEAPOLIS IS REQUIRING 
FOR PAYMENT IN OUR ORDINANCE SO 
IT'S GOING TO BE BEING TO SEE 
H 
COMPANIES.  
      AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THE 
SECOND PART ABOUT A NEW COMPANY 
IS -- IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND
A LOT OF TIME TO START A NEW 
BUSINESS.  AND THIS FEELS 
EXTREMELY RUSHED.  A MONTH AGO 
WE VOTED ON AN EXTENSION FOR THE
ORIGINAL DATE FOR THIS POLICY TO
BE ENACTED AND I RECALL 
COLLEAGUES SAYING:  OH, YEAH, 
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TIME.  BY 
APRIL 1st.  WE JUST NEED TO 
EXTEND IT FOR ANOTHER MONTH.  
NOW WE'RE GOING FOR T MORE 
MONTHS.  I MEAN, I'M HOPING 
WE'RE GOING TO FIX BUT IT'S A 
LOT OF WORK TO START A NEW 
BUSINESS.  IT'S A LOT OF STRESS 
TO PUT ON NEW BUSINESS OWNERS TO
START THIS, TO GET IT GOING.  
YOU KNOW, TO WORK OUT THE 
KINKS -- NOT ALL THE KINKS.  WE 
OLD YOUR COMPANY IS, YOU'RE  HOW
STILL WORKING OUT THE KINKS BUT 
TO WORK OUT THE KINKS ENOUGH -- 
SOME OF THE CONCERNS IDENTIFY 
HEARD ABOUT -- -- I'VE HEARD 
ABOUT THEE BACKGROUND CHECKS AN 
THE VEHICLES, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE CHECKED OUT AND SO 
I'M REALLY HOPING THAT TH -- 
I'M SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I'M 
HOPING THAT THESE TWO MONONTHS  
GOING TO GIVE US TIME BUTUT I A 
DOUBTFUL THAT THAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN AND, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING 
TO END WITH JUSUST SAYING AS A 
COUNCIL WE JUST CAN'T CONTINUE 
MAKE THESE KINDS ODECISIONS.  
IF YOU MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT 
FACTS -- WE HAD A DATE TO WAIT 
FOR THE FACTS.  IF YOU MAKE 
THES KINDS OF DECISIONS WITHOUT
FACTS, WE'RE NO BETTER THAN 
DONALD TRUMP.  THANK YOU.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE?
>> WHOA!  
(LAUGH.)
>> DONALD TRUMP, WHEW!  FIRST OF
ALL, I WANT TO THANK THE 
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
EMAILED AND TEXT AND CALLED THE 
WARD 3 OFFICE TO EXPLAIN THE 
TRAUMA THAHAT THIS HASTILY PASS 
ORDINANCE HAS CAUSED TO THEIR 
LIVES AND THE UNCERTAINTY THAT 
THAT HAS CAUD.  
      AND I WILL BE VOTINING FO 
THIS THIRD DEADLINE BECAUSESE W 
HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT.  AND 
THIS, HOPEFULLY, GIVE US A TIME 
TO INCLUDE THE STATE AND UBER 
AND LYFT AND ANY OF THE NEW 
COMPANIES -- I SEE SOME HERE 
TOY.  IN THIS ZHUGS 
    BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW WE 
HAVE NOT INCLUDED ALL THOSE 
PARTIES TO SAY THE DIFFERENT 
WAYS THAN COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW 
DID.  WE HAVE TO BE INCLUSIVE 
AND TRANSPARENT OF EVERYBODY 
THAT THIS ORDINANCE WILL AFFECT.
SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS B T
WE ACTUALLY SHOULDN'TUT ANY 
DEADLINE ON.  WE SHOULD NOT DO 
ANYTHING UNTIL WE GET THIS
RIGHT.  THANK YOU.  
>> I SEE COUNCIL MEMBER CHAVEZ 
IN QUEUE BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS 
FOR COUNCIL MEMBER OSMAN.  
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, PRESIDENT 
PAYNE.  
      IANTED TO KIND OF REMIND
US THAT IF WE BELIEVE MINIMUM 
WAGE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID 
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.  BUT I WANT
TO TALK TO THE DRIVERS.  I KNOW 
IS IS CONFUSED YOU ALL.  THAT 
YOU HAVE SHOWN UP THE LAST TWO 
YEARS AND YOU ARE IN THE 
AUDIENCE TODAY.  
      THIS IS AN EXTENSION WE'RE
DOING REASONABLE THAT WE ARE 
TRYI TO WORK WITH THE STATE, 
TRYING TO GET TO A SOLUTION.  WE
ARE COMMITTED TO YOU.  WWILL 
CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO YOU 
TO GET A FAIR WAGE LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE.  LIKIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
SITTING HERE IN THE CITY OF 
MINNEAPOLIS GETS THE FAIR WAGE. 
THEY GET THAT PROTECTION.  AND 
YOU DESERVE THATAT PROTECTION.  
      SO WE'RE COMMITTED AND I 
WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL 
MEMBERS WHO I'VE BEEN HAVAVING 
CONVERSATION -- COUNCIL MEMBER 
CHOUDHURY AND CASHMAN WHO HAVE 
SHOWN LEADERSHIP AND WORKED FOR 
THE STATE AND MAKING SURE WE'RE 
NOT THE SCAPEGOAT IF THERE'S 
ANY, YOU KNOW -- ANYTHING THA 
HAPPENS ON THE STATESIDE.  THAT 
WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU. 
WE'RE WILLING, WE'RE COMMITTED 
PASSING MINIMUM WAGE FAIR FOR 
THE DRIVERS.  
      THIS EXTENSION MIGHT NOT 
INFLUENCE THE THREAT OF UBER AND
LYFT COMPANIES SAYING THEY'RE 
LEAVING.  WE'RE HOSTAGE TO THEM.
IF WE HAD COMPETITION IF WE HAD 
OTHER COMPANIES WE WOULD NOT BE 
IN THIS PLACE TODAY.  SO THIS 
EXTENSION IS A GOOD FAITH ON OUR
SIDE FOR THE STAT FOR THE NEW 
APPS, THE NEW COMPANIES COMING 
IN WITH THEHREATS OF UBER AND 
LYFT HOLNG US HOSTAGE.  IT'S 
STILL OUT THERE.  SO JUST -- I 
JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU ALL 
THAT WHAT WE DID IS PROTECTING 
THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT THE 
MOST.  DRIVERS HAVE BEEN HERE.  
HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING, HAVE BEEN 
SHOWING UP AND THEY DESERVE 
PROTECTION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH, COUNCIL 
PRESIDENT.  
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
OSMAN.  VICE PRESIDENT CHUGHTAI?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
YOU KNOW, I REALLY APPRECIATE 
SOME OF COUNCIL MEMBER OSMAN'S 
COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY.  JUST 
AROUND, YOU KNOW, THIS -- THIS 
IS -- THIS IS ABOUT HELPING 
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST.  
AND DRIVERS AND WORKERS, REALLY,
WHO ARE EXPLOITED BY THESE TWO 
CORPORATIONS THAT HOLD SO MUCH 
POWER IN -- IN THE RIDE-SHARE 
ECONOMY.  AND, YOU KNOW, OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AS A GOVERNMENT 
AGENCY IN HAVING THEIR BACACK I 
AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I THINK 
IT'S ONE WE ALL TAKE VERY 
SEL
SERIOUSLY AND I'M REAY GLAD 
WEWE'RE WILLING TO ADMIT WHEN IS
TIME FOR US TO SLOW DOWN AND 
TIME FOR US TO GET TO THE VERY 
BEST OUTCOME IN -- IN THE 
CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE IN AT A 
GIVEN TIME.  
      SO RIGHT NOW, WE ARE 
ACACTUALLY MAKING A LOT OF 
PROGRESS IN OUR WORK WITH THE 
STATE.  
      WE ARE -- WE CONTINUE TO 
TALK TO THEM.  SOMEBODY FROM 
THIS COUNCIL TALKS TO THEM ERY
DAY.  AND WE ARE GETTING CLOSER 
AND CLOSER T HAVING ONE SHARED 
DERSTANDING AND ONE SHAD 
WAGE THAT -- THAT -- THAT IS -- 
THAT WORKED BOTH BETWEEN THE 
STATE AND THE CITY AND FINDING 
POLICY SOLUTIONSHAT ALLOW 
MINNEAPOLIS TO -- TO -- TO 
EATE A MINIMUM WAGE THAT WORKS
FOR OUR ECONOMY WHILE ALSO BEING
COMPLEMENTARY TO A STATEWIDE 
WAGE AND THAT IT ALONE TO ME IS 
ENOUGH O OF A REASON FOR US TO 
SL DOWN.  THAT WE ARE GETTING 
CLOSER TO -- TO A PLACE OF 
AGREEMENT WITH OUR STATE.  
      AND AS THEY WORK TOWARDS 
THE END THEIR LEGISLATIVE 
SESSION THIS YEAR, THEY CONTINUE
TO WANT TO ENGAG WITH US AND 
WANT US TO BE GOOD FAITH 
PARTNERS AND THIS IS US, YOU 
KNOW, MEETING THEM HALFWAY AND 
ALL OF US TO WORK TETHER SO I  
FEEL REALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT IN 
THE NEXT -- IN THE NEXT COUPLE 
 MONTHS, THIS EXTENSION BOTH 
ALLOWS US TO GET TO A STATEWIDE 
POLICY THAT'S COMPLEMENTARY TO A
MINNEALIS POLICY AND IT ALLOWS
US TIME FOR RIDER ADOPTION OF 
WHATEVER NEW RIDE-SHARE 
COMPANIES ARE COMING INTO OUR 
MARKET.  I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL
THAT -- THAT ARE -- THAT DRIVERS
HAVE A PRETTY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AND ARE STARTING TO WORK 
WITH AND WE WANT THAT SAME TYPE 
OF TIME FOR RIDERS TO -- TO GET 
TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF 
RELATIONSHIP WITH WHOEVER IS NEW
AND COMING INTO OUR MARKET.  
      AND I THINK FOR THOSE TWO 
REASONS, I'M EXCITED T TO SUPPO 
THIS AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE
TO COUNCIL MEMBER PAYNE AND 
COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN AND 
COUNCIL MEMBER CHOUDHURY FOR 
YOUR WORK ON THIS.  
>> THANK YOU, VICE PRESIDENT 
CHUGHTAI.  
      COUNCIL MEMBER CHAVEZ?
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL PRESIDENT 
PAYNE AND  ALSO WANT TO THANK 
THE AUTHORS OF BRINGING THIS 
FORWARD.  I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT 
BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT
WE WILL NEVER ALLOW UBER AND 
LYFT TO CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT OUR 
IMMIGRANT, BLACK ANDEOPLE OF 
COLOR DRIVERS ANY LONGER.  THE 
HOSTAGE SITUATION THAT T WE HAV 
BY THEM CONTINUING TO THREATEN 
AND LEAVING OUR CITY AND 
CONTINUE EXPLOITING OUR WORKERS 
WITH TEMPER TANTRUMS IS 
UNACCEPTABLE.  SO I'LL BE 
SUPPORTING HIJACK I THINK IT'S A
GOOD-FAITH EFFORT.  I APPRECIATE
THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS 
FORWARD AND I WANT TO DISPUTE 
BEING CALLED DONALD TRUMP.  IF 
THAT'S THE CASE I WOULD VOTE NO 
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN 
WORKERS RIGHT AND I BELIEVE IN 
IT WORKERS RIGHTS, THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
CHAVEZ.  I PUT MYSELF INUEUE. 
JUST TO THANK MY CO-AUTHORS, 
COUNL MEMBERS CASHMAN AND 
COUNCIL MEMBERS CHOUDHURY.  THIS
HAS BEEN A VERY COMPLEX TOPIC TO
FOLLOWING.  PART OF THE 
COMPLEXITIES IS JUST T NATURE 
OF THE MARKET.  IT'S VERY 
DYNAMIC AND THERE'S A LOT OF 
STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE 
IMPACTING -- A LOT OFHE 
SHAREHO
STAKEHOLDERS ARE IN THIS ROOM.  
THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE STATE 
CAPITAL AND THE STAKEHOLDERS 
DOWNTOWN AND IT'S THE 
CROSS-COLLABORATION AMO 
STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BROUGHT 
US TO O THIS POINT AND I BELIEV 
WEL GET TO A BETTE OUTCOME AT
THIS POINT SO I REALLY 
APPRECIATE IT.  
      SEEING NO OTHER 
DISCUSSION, I'LL ASK THE CRK 
TO CALL THE ROLL.  
(ROLL CALL.)  
>> THERE ARE 13 AYES.  
>> THAT CARRIES.  AND THAT 
AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED.  
      ARE THERE ANY FURTHER 
AMENENDMENTS?
I SEE COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO 
IN QUEUE.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.  I'D 
LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO RESCIND
THE TRANSPORTATION RIDE-SHARE 
WORKER PROTECTIONS ORDINANCE AND
IF I CAN GET A SECOND,, I THEN 
HAVE SOME REMARKS ON THAT.  
>> SECOND.  
>> FIRST, COLLEAGAGUES, I'D LIK 
TO THANK COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS 
FOR FINDING A W WAY FOR US TO SP
IS TRAIN.  SHE I IS THE REASON 
WHY WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE A PAUSE
TODAY AND ALL OF YOUR APPROVAL 
ON THAT IS ACTUALLY REALLY 
HEARTENING.  
      THIS ORDINANCE WAS AWFULLY
MISGUIDED.  A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH
HERE IS TO STSTART OVER.  
INTERESTINGLY, THERE'S ALREADY A
LOT OF IDEAS AS TO HOW AND I 
WELCOME THEM TO START WITH A 
CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER.  
      THIS ORDINANCE STARTED 
WITH THE GOOD INTENT TO ENSURE 
EVERY RIDE-SHARE DRIVER EARNED A
CITY MANDATED MINIMUM WAGE.  BUT
IT IS NOW SO TAINTED WITH 
NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION AND 
OUTCRY THAT I FIND IT 
UNSALVABLE.  IT'S CALLED UBER
AND LYFT TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO 
CI OF MINNEAPOLIS.  I'M SURE 
I'M RECEIVING THE SAME 
COMMUNICATIONS THAT YOUR OFFICES
ARE.  PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME IN 
PUBLIC LIKE YOU ALL TOGETHER ARE
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE UPSET, 
ANGRY, FRUSTRATED AND DOWN RIGHT
DESPONDENT OVER THIS ORDINANCE. 
YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE RECEIVING 
MORE COMMUNICATIONS THAN  
OFFICIALLY BECAUSESE I'M 1 OF 
THREE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO 
SEE WHAT A MONUMENTALLY BAD BILL
THIS WAS.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THIS BILL WAS CLEAR BEFORE ME 
BEFORE THIS VOTE.  IOST 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENENCES IT'S 
INTENDED.  IT'S CLEAR TO SEE 
LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WOULD BE 
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED EVEN IF A 
SMALL AMOUNT OF FORETHOUGHT 
WOULD BE PUT IN THIS.  
RIDE-SHARE DRIVERS ARE NOT A 
MONOLITH THEY'RE A DIVERSE GROUP
OF PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE THIS WORK 
FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF REASONS 
WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE 
BENEFIT FROM THIS IS NEGLIGENT. 
I'VE HEARD FROM MANY DRIRS 
TELLING THEIR TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT 
THIS WILL DO TO THEM.  IT MEANS 
MORE COMPETITION FOR LESS RIDES 
IF THE PRICE OF THE RIDES GOES 
UP.  IT MEANS LOSS OF TIR 
SOURCE OF INCOME AND ABILITY TO 
PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES.  TNC
DRIVERS WHO HAD FINANCED THEIR 
CARS HAD THEM RECALLED FOR A 
COUPLE OF DRIVERS IN MY O WARD
THAT HE HAS EVERYTHING TO THEIR 
ABILITY -- THAT MEANS EVERYTHING
TO THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR 
THEIR FAMILY AND COMPETITION FOR
THE UBER COLLEGE PROGRAM ONE OF 
MY CONSTITUENTS IS THREEOURSES
AWAY FROM CREATING -- FROM BEING
ABLE TO FINALLY COMPLETE HIS 
COLLEGE DEGREE.  THESE AREN'T 
HYPOETICALS.  THEY'RE ALREADY 
HAPPENING.  
      HOW DID THIS COUNCIL PUSH 
THROUGH AN ORDINANCE THEY 
THOUGHT WASAS BEST WITHOUT TAKI 
INTO ACCOUNT DATA AND THEILL 
OF THE PEOPLE?
      DID THEY NOT CARE?
THAT'S NOT TRUE.  W WE ALL CARE 
BUT EVEN AS I SPEAK THIS WEEK IT
SES SADLY OTHER KINDS OF 
VICTORIES OR SELF-PROMOTION IS 
MORE IMPORTANT AND FRANKLY THAT 
MAKES ME SAD.  
      THERE ARE MANY 
GOVERNMENTAL AND NONPROFIT 
AGENCIES THAT SUPPLY MEDICAL OR 
CADI COMMUNITY ACCESS INCLUSION 
THESE ARE CONTRACTS HELD WITH 
UBER AND LYFT.T.  WHAT HAPPENS  
THESE FOLKS WHEN UBER AND LYFT 
LEAVE THE MARKET.  UPCOMING TNC 
COMPANIES LESSEN BE READY TO 
TAKE ON THAT WORK -- COMPANIES 
WILL NOT BE READY TO TAKE ON 
THAT WORK.  THEY WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO VENT POSSIBLE PARTNS. 
TO ENSURE THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING 
MET AND THEN NEGOTIATE A 
CONTCT.  THESE CLIENTSTS ARE 
GOING TO BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY  
SUPPORTED TRANSPORTATION.  
      SO SUGGEST THAT UBER AND 
LYFT CAN CHOOSE TO LEAVE THIS 
MARKET AND NEW COMPANIES WILL 
FILL THIS VOID IS A INFANCY.  
THE VOID FOR 100,000 RIDES PER 
WEEK IN THE MET AREA IS NOT 
GOING TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN 
EVEN TWO MORE MONTHS.  NEW 
VENDORS DON'T HAVE THE STRUCTURE
AND TECHNOLOGY TO FILL HIJACK 
THIS WILL TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY 
AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY TO 
CRE 
THOSE WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL ARE
PRIVILEGED.  
      THIS IMMEDIATELY PUTS 
THOSE WITHOUT MEANS AT A 
DISADVANTAGE AND IT'S GOING TO 
PERPETUATE THEIR HISTORIC 
MARGINALIZATION.  SO LET'S GO 
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND 
CRAFT AN ORDINANCE THAT MEETS 
THE NEEDS OF DRIVERS OF RIDERS 
IN THE COMMUNITY AT-LARGE OR LET
THE STATE LEGISLATURE DIRECT A 
STATE PLAN.  MINNEAPOLIS GOING 
ALONE AND DAMAGING ITSELF, THE 
METRO AREA AND THE REST OF THE 
STATE HAS PROVEN TO BE FOLLY.  
      I AM WILLING TO SUPPORT AN
ENTIRELY NEW COMMONSENSE 
ORDINANCE THAT FULFILLS THE 
GOALS OF EVERY DRIVER RECEIVING 
A MINIMUM WAGE WHILE NOT DOING 
HARM TO THE REST OF THE 
COMMUNITY.  I KNOW THIS IS 
POSSIBLE IF MY COLLEAGUES ARE 
WILLING.  SOME OF YOU HAVE 
IMPORTANT IDEAS THAT YOU'RE 
LOOKING TO INCORPORATE IN A 
DIFFERENT ORDINANCE.  I DOUBT 
THERE IS THE WILL HERE TODAY BUT
I AM HERE TO SAY:  LET'S START 
OVER.  
(APPLAUSE.) 
>> COUNCIL MEMBER WONSLEY?
>> WELL SAID, WELL SAID.  GOD 
BLESS YOU.  
>> SO I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME 
CLARITY FOR THE PUBLIC ABOUT 
THIS PROCESS AS THERE HAS BEEN 
LOTS OF ERASURE OF THE
INTENTIONALITY THAT WENT INTO 
THIS POLICY PROCESS.  
      THIS POLICY WAS NOT DONE 
IN A HASTE.  THERE WAS 2 YEARS 
OF WORK THAT WE DID INTO THE -- 
THAT WENT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT 
 THIS POLICY STARTING LAST 
YEAR WHERE HUNDREDS OF DRIVERS, 
AFTER HAVING COME TO CITY HALL 
SEVERAL TIMES, WHERE SEVERAL 
COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE HERE 
PRECEDINGG MYSELF HEARD FROM 
DRIVERS THAT THEY WERE BEING 
EXPLOITED BY THESE TWO CORPORATE
GIANTS AND THEY NEEDED 
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.  THAT 
THEY WERE NOT BEING PAID THE 
WAGES THAT WAS NEEDED OR THAT 
WAS IN ALIGNMENT WITH 70,000 
OTHER WORKERS WHO RECEIVE A 
MINIMUM WAGE HERE IN 
MINNEAPOLIS.  
      FROM THAT, COUNCIL TOOK 
ACTION TO INITIATE A LEGISLATIVE
PROCES SPECIFICALLY ME, COUNCIL
MEMBERS OSMAN AS WELL AS 
COUNCICIL MEMBER CHAVEZ.  WE 
INITIATED THE LEGISISLATIVE 
PROCESS.  AND WHAT DID WE DO 
FIRST?
WE SAID:  THIS POLICY HAS TO BE 
BACKED BY DATA SO WE INITITIATEA
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE THAT ASKED
THE MAYOR'S STAFF TO DO OUR 
ANALYSIS THAT WILL GET US A 
MINIMUM WAGE EQUIVALENT FOR 
MINNEAPOLIS FOR RIDE-SHARE 
DRIVERS.  THAT IT TOOK SEVERAL 
MONTHS.  
      AND WHILE THEY WERE DOING 
THAT PROCES WE OFFERED TO MEET
WITH EVERY SINGLE 
COUNCIL MEMBER.  AND WE ASKED 
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.  WE ASKED FOR
YOUR INPUT.  WE ASKED YOU FOR 
ANY IDEAS THAT YOU HAD TO HELP 
SHAPE THIS POLICY.  NONE OF YOU 
SAID ANYTHING.  AND THEN WE 
TRANSITIONED INTO HAVING 
BRIEFINGS ABOUT THE FINDINGS 
FROM THE EXECUTIVE STAFF'S 
REPORT THAT GOT US A $1.40 PER 
MILE AND A 51-PER CENT MINUTE.  
      WE ALSO HAD COMMUNITY 
PUBL SESSIONS WHERE WE ASKED 
RESIDENTS:  WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THIS?
WEAD THIS ALL THROUGHOUT THE 
FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD QUARTRT 
OF LAST YEAR.  SO WE WENT INTO
AUGUST OF LAST YEAR WITH THE 
PROPOSAL OF $1.40 AND 51-CENT 
PER MINUTE HAVING THAT EXTENSIVE
ENGAGEMENT, HAVING THE ANALYSIS 
THAT WAS NOT JUST SHAPED BY THE 
MAYOR'S STAFF BUT WAS DONE IN 
CONSTATION WITH NATIONAL 
EXPERTS, THOSE WHO ALSO AUTHORED
THE STATE'S DLI REPORT.  AND 
THEN YOU ALL VOTED IT DOWN.  AT 
LEAST A VARIETY OF YOU V VOTED  
DOWN IN AUGUST AND MAYOR FREY 
VETOED IT.  AND THEN YOU SAID 
LET'S DO THIS.  LET'S START FROM
RATCH.  LET'S THINK THROUGH 
HO WE CAN GET DRIVERS A MINIMUM
WAGE AND MANY OF YOU SAID 
ACTUALLY THAT IS WHERE THERE IS 
ALIGNMENT.  WE DO AGREEHAT 
DRIVERS SHOULD EARN A MINIMUM 
WAGE AND IN RESPONSE TO A 
MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS ON 
THIS BODY SAYING:  WE WANT 
DRIVERS TO EARN A MINIMUM WAGE, 
THE CO-AUTHS DECIDED TO 
INITIATE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS
ALL OVER AGAIN AND PRIORITIZED 
THE MIMUM WAGE BECAUSE WE 
IDENTIFIED THAT AS HAVING SHARED
AGREEMENT AMONGst THIS BODY.  
      AND WHAT DO WE DO?
WE STARTED ALL OVEAGAIN.  WE 
INVITED EVERY SINGLE 
COUNCIL MEMBERS TO DO THE 101 
BRIEFINGS WITH THE CO-AUTHORS TO
BRING IDEAS AND SHAPE THIS 
POLICY.  
      WE MET WITH THE MAYOR'S 
OFFICE.  WE HADONVERSATIONS 
WITH OUR STATE LEADERS AND WE 
EVEN RECEIVED ACTUALLY FROM 
THOSE CONVERSATIONS SEVERAL 
COMPENSATION RECOMMENDATIONS AND
BECAUSE AGAIN WE PRIORITIZED 
RESEARCH, WE ASKED OUR OWN STAFF
FOR THE SECOND TIME TO DO OUR 
RERESEARCH ANALYSIS COMPARING O 
PROPOSALO THE SEVERAL OTHER 
COMPENSATION RATES PROPOSED BY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE MAYOR'S 
OFFICE.  THAT CAME FORWARD EARLY
THIS YEAR AND IT FOUND THAT THE 
$1.40 AS WELL AS THE 51-CENT PER
MINUTE WAS THE CLOSEST TO 
QUARA
GUARANTEEING DRIVERSRS HERE IN 
MINNEAPOLIS A MINIMUM WAGE 
EQUIVALENT.  NO ONE HAS BEEN 
BLINDSIDED BY THIS PROCESS.  FOR
2 YEARS.  WE HA DONE 
EVERYTHING TO ENGAGE C CRITICAL 
STAKEHOLDERS AND STILL ARE DOING
THAT.  WE HAVE BASED OUR POLICY 
EVEN WHEN THE STATE DID NOT DO 
THEIR RESEARCH, WE DID OUR 
HOMEWORKRK BECAUSE WE KNEW WE 
WANTED TO GROUNDD A WAGE THAT WS
BASED ON FACTS.  WE DID OUR
HOMEWORK NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE BUT
THREE TIMES NOW.  SI WANT TO 
HIGHLIGHT THERE WAS SO MUCH 
INTENTIONALITY POUREDD INTO THI 
POLICY AND ALSO I DON'T AGREE 
THAT WE'RE IN THIS POSITION 
WHERE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AND 
RIDERS LIKE OUR DISABLED 
COMMUNITIES ARE BEING PITTED 
AGAINST DRIVERS WHO ARE ALSO 
PREDOMINATELY BLACK, IMMIGRANT 
AND BROWN WHO ARE POOR AND 
DISPROPORTIONATELY RELYING ON 
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THEMSELVES -- 
WE KNOW WHEN IT COMOMES TO SERV 
OUR VULNERABLELE COMMUNITIES, T 
WORKFORCE FOR DISABLED FOLKS FOR
CHILDREN ARE OFTEN PAID THE 
LOWEST OF WAGES.  
      SO THIS SHOULD NOT BE A 
TIME WHERE WE ALL RIDERS WHO 
ARE VULNERABLE AS DRIVERS WHO 
ARE VULNERABLE TO BE PITTED 
AGAINST EACH OTHER.  YOU AS 
RIDERS DESERVE AFFORDABLE 
SERVICES AND UBER AND LYFT CAN 
PROVIDE THAT TO YOU.  THEY'RE 
CHOOSING NOT TO AND THEY ALSO 
ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A $15 
MINIMUM WAG TO OUR DRIVERS AS 
WELL IT'S A CHOICE THAT THEY 
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.  SO I 
ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE 
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING 
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO BE 
DIVIDED BECAUSE THAT DIVISION IS
BEING LEVERAGED BY TWO
MULTIBILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS
WHO ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO CARE 
ABOUT DISILITIES OR DISABLED 
RESIDENTS 'CAUSE THEY FOUGHT ADA
COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND THEY 
ALALSO DON'T CARE ABOUT T 
DRIVERS THAT THEY EXPLOIT EVERY 
SINGLE DAY.  
      SO I WANT LEVEL-SET HOW WE
GOT HERE TODAY?
THE RESEARCH THAT, THE WORK THAT
WENT INTO THIS PROCESS.  WE DID 
NOT GO INTO THIS FOOLISHLY.  WE 
WENT INTO THIS THOUGHTFULLY AND 
IT'S EXACTLY WHY TODAY I WILL 
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WHAT WE 
PASSED LAST MONTH BY A SUPER 
MAJORITY.  
(APPLAE.) 
>> WE VOTED WITH -- 
(SPEAKER NOT MIC'D.) 
>> CONSIDER THAT.  
>> I PUT MYSELF IN QUEUE 'CAUSE 
COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO BROUGHT
UP THE ISSUE OF SOME OF THE 
DRIVER HARDSHIPS THAT T SHE'S 
HEARD FROM HER COMMUNITY AND I 
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO 
HIGHLILIGHT THAT THOSE HARDSHIP 
ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TODAY 
UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF 
THE MARKETPLACE.  AND THOSE 
HARDSHIPS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION NOW.  
AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE ALREADY 
TAKEN ACTION AND THIS IS ABOUT 
REFINING THIS POLICY THIS IS 
NOT ABOUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH.
WE ALREADY KNOW THE HARDSHIPS 
THAT DRIVERS ARE EXPERIENCING 
UNDER THE CURRENT REALITY THAT 
EXISTS TODAY.  SO I WON'T BE 
SUPPORTING A RESCINDING OF THIS.
WE'VE ALREADY PUTNTO PROCESS A
WAY TO REFINE THIS TO MAKE IT BE
A RAE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION 
THAT WORKS -- A REALLY 
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT  
WORKS BOTH FOR THE MINNEAPOLIS 
AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE STATE 
AND WE DON'T NEED TO START FROM 
SCRATCH AS COUNCIL MEMBER 
WONSLEY HIGHLIGHTED WE'VE DONE A
LOT OF REALLY D DEEP WORK HERE D
IS READY TO REFINE THAT WORK 
GOING FORWARD.  AND I CALL ON 
COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  I 
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE RECORD 
THAT I MET WITH THE AUTHORS OF 
THIS EVERY SINGLE TIME IT WAS 
REQUESTED.  AND I ADDEDED MY 
THOUGHTS AROUND DISABILITY 
RIDERS WHICH DID MAKE BET INTO
THE ORDINANCE.  SO TO SAY THAT 
NO ONE RESPONDED AND NO ONE 
ADDED ANYTHING IS JUST FACTUALLY
UNTRUE.  
      I DO THINK WE DO HAVE SOME
NEWATA THAT CAN HELP US 
DETERMINE WHAT IS THECTUAL 
FAIR AMOUNT THAT WE CAN BE 
ASSURED THAT DRIVERS ARE MAKING 
A MINIMUM WAGE AS WELL AS 
MAINTAIN THE RIDE-SHARE SERVICES
THAT MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN OUR 
COMMUNITY DEPEND ON FOR THEIR 
LIVELIHOODS. OR THEIR ACCESS 
TO MEDICAL, EDUCATIONAL 
EMPLOYMENT RESOURC THAT ARE SO
DESPERATELY NEEDED.  
      SO TO RECONSIDER THIS -- 
THIS IDEA, WHICH I BROUGHT FORTH
PERTINENT CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND, YOU
 
OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART
BUT IT HAS BEEN STATED, THERE'S 
BEEN MUCH WORK THAT HAS BEEN 
GOINING ON IN HAD THIS PROCESS. 
SO I THINK WE NEED TO REFINE NOT
NECESSARILY RESCIND.  THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
JENKINS.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
CHOUDHURY?
>> YEA  I JUST WANTED TO STATE
FOR THE RECORD -- THANK YOU, 
PRESIDT PAYNE.  THAT I WILL 
NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS MOTION TO
RESCIND.  I THINK COUNCIL MEMBE
JENKINS DID A GOOD JOB JUST 
SHARING THAT THIS IS A MOMENT 
FOR US TO REFINE A AND HAVE 
DISCUSSIONS.  I THINK TO RESCIND
AND DELETE THE OINANCE IN ITS 
ENTIRETY WOULD BE A GREAT 
DISSERVICE TO THE WORKERS AND 
OUR STATE LEADERS THAT -- THAT 
ARE WILLING TO COME TO THE TLE
WITH US.  I THINK IT'S NOT AN 
ALIGNMENT WITH THE DISISCUSSION 
THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THEM AND 
THE POTENTIAL DISCUSSIONS THAT 
WE WANT TO HAVE WITITH THE 
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.  
      I ALSO JUST WANT TO 
NAME -- IT HAS NEVER IN HISTORY 
BEEN EASY TO CHALLENGE 
EXPLOITIVE SYSTEMS AND ASK FOR A
CHANGE.  THIS IS -- WE ARE -- WE
ARE NOT IN A VACUUM IN THE 
CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS.  WE ARE 
PARTICIPATING IN ADDRESSING AN 
EXPLOITIVE SYSTEM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY THAT HAS LED TO MULTIPLE
MUNICIPALITIES AND WHOLE STAS 
ASKING UBER AND LYFT TO NO 
LONGER EXPLOIT THEIR WORKERS AND
I JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND AND
SAY:  WE NEED TO SHIFT OUR 
ATTENTION TO THE -- TO THOSE 
COMPANIES THAT HAVEHE ABILITY 
TO CHANGE THIS AND NOT IMPOSE 
HIGHER COSTS ON THE RIDERSHIP 
AND NOT PIT WORKING PEOPLE 
AGAINST EACH OTHER JUST TO MAKE 
A HIGHER PROFIT OR TO APPEASE 
THEIR INVESTORS AND THEY NEED TO
BE READY TO COME TO THE TABLE TO
MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS SO I WILL
NOT BE RESCINDING TODAY.  
(APPLAUSE.) 
>> COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO?
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.  I 
DON'T MEAN TO BELABOR THIS 
ANYMORE.  YOUR TIMELINES ARE 
SUITABLE FOR POLITICS AND FOR 
POLITICIANS BUT NOT FOR THE 
PEOPLE HAVE MINNEAPOLIS.  LET'S 
START OVER.  WE CAN H HAVE THE 
REST OF THE BODY STAKEHOLDERS OF
WHICH THERE ARE MANY, AT THE 
TABLE.  
      YOU KNOW, ONE IMPORTANT 
THING FROM THISHOLE PROCESS 
WASO SEE WHO IS TAKING 
RIDE-SHARE AND WHERE THEY ARE 
GOING.  PEOPLE -- I'VE LEARNED 
ARE TAKING RIDE-SHARE T TO GET  
THEIR DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS.  IN MY 
OWN WARD, SOME OF THE -- T THE 
MOST OPT FREQUENTLY STARTING AND
STOPPING POINTS IS OUR LOCAL 
HIGH SCHOOL AND OUR SKILLED 
NURSING FACILITY.  
      OTHER PLACES THAT PEOPLE 
GO MOST OFTEN OR MORE OFTEN THAN
NOT ARE  TARGET, THE GROCERY 
STORE, OTHER HEALTHCARE 
PROVIDERS.  THIS IS HOW SOME 
PEOPLE USE IT TO GET TO THEIR 
DAY-TOTO-DAY NEEDS.  
      SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
STSTART WITH A CLEAN CANVAS.  Y 
CAN START FROM SCRATCH AND GET 
TO SOMETHI BETTER ON THE SAME 
TIMELINE WE ARE OPERATING O
NOW.  
      WE GOGOT HERE TODAY, AS I 
SAID BEFORE, WE GOT HERE TODAY 
BY RELYING ON INFORMATION FROM 
ANOTHER CITY.  WE DID NOT WANT 
TO WAIT F LOCAL DATA.  THIS 
ENTIRE ORDINANCE WAS BASED ON 
BAD DATA AND I THINK WE NEED A 
FRESH START AND A FRESH LOOK 
BASED ON THE DATA THAT'S NOW 
BEEN PROVIDED.  
      IT THEN ALLOWS US THE 
AMOUNTS OF FEEDBACK WE'VE 
RECEIVED.  THANK YOU.  
>> I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE ELSE IN
QUEUE FOR DISCUSSION.  I WL 
ASK THE CLERK TO CALL THE ROLL. 
(PAUSE.) 
>> COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE?
>> AND I'M SORRY THE MICROPHONES
ARE PROBLEMS.  YOU MAY HAVE TO 
ACTIVATE YOUR OWN SWITCH.  I'M 
SORRY FOR THAT.  
(ROLL CALL.) 
>> THERE ARE 3 AYES AND 10 NAYS.
>> THAT AMENDMENT FAILS.  ARE 
THERE ANY FURTHER AMENDMENTS?
COUNCIL MEMBER KOSKI?
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAYNE.  
      COLLEAGUES, COUNCIL 
MEMBERS JENKINS ARE BRINGING 
FORWARD THAT ADJUSTMENTS T PER
MILE RATES AND REMAINS THE -- 
THE AMENDMENTS PER MILE RATE 
$1.21 IS THE COMPREHENSIVE RATE 
RECOMMENDEDED IN THE STATE'S 
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY
REPORT.  IT IS BASED ON DLI'S 
DATASET OF MORE THAN 18 MILLION 
MINNESOTA TRIPS AND DRIVER 
EARNINGS.  THIS RATE INCLUDES 
THE MINNEAPOLIS MINIMUM WAGE 
PLUS BENEFITS.  IN MY 
CONVERSATIONS WITH STATE LEADERS
THE DEBATE THERE IS BETWEEN 89 
CENTS AND 1.21. S SO THIS IS 
SETTING US AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
RANGE.  AGAIN, IN THE TOP OF THE
RANGE WHICHCH IS ROOTED IN THEI 
ROBUST DATA.  THE AMENDMENTS PER
MINUTE RATE IS 51 CENTS AND AS 
THE RATEN THE POLICY AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT IS BASED 
ON SPECIFIC FACTORS LIKE CAR 
RENTALS, GAS, INSURANCE NOT 
CONSIDERED IN THE STATE'S DLI 
REPORT.  RIDERSHIP AND 
DECISION-MAKING INCLUDES 
DECISION-MAKING INFORMED CNGES
WHILE EMBRACING UNCERTAINTY AND 
ADAPTING TO NEW INFORMATION.  MY
GOALS HAVE AND CONTINUE TO 
ENSURE A FAIR WAGES FOR DRIVERS.
STABILITY FOR DRIVERS AND RIDERS
AND A HEALTHY COMPETITIVE 
MARKET.  THIS AMENDMENT ACHIEVES
ALL THESE GOALS.  
      TRANSPORTATION NWORK 
COMPANIES ARE PAYING DRIVERS A 
SUBMINIMUM WAGE.  THE CITY 
UNCIL TOOK ACTION TO FIX THAT.
THE STATE AND THE CITY HAVE 
WORKED DILIGENTLY TO RESEARCH 
AND ENABLES DATA AND THE -- 
ENABLING DATA AND AN ADJUSTMENT 
TO THE RIDE-SHARE ORDINANCE.  WE
MU NOW TAKE ACTION TO ADJUST 
ACCORDINY.  
      WE LEARNED WHILE THERE MAY
BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE
FORM OF AN EXTREMELY BROAD RANGE
OF OUTCOMES, W WE WILL NOT RECEE
A SINGLE DATA POINT OR RANGE TO 
BE UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED AS THE 
CORRECT COMPENSATION RATES.  THE
CURRENT RATES ARE BASED ON OUR 
POLICY AND RESEARCH DECISION 
ANALYSIS WHICH WAS DONE W WITH E
LIMITED DATA THEY WERE ABLE TO 
OBTAIN WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE 
DATA FROM UBER AND LYFT.  THE 
STATE'S DLI ANALYSIS WAS DONE 
WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DATA AND
INCLUDED DATA LIKE I SAID,, FRO 
18 MILLION UBER AND LYFT TRIPS 
TO THE STATE BUT PREDOMINATELY 
IN THE CITY.  
      IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
TAKE THE INFORMAMATION BEFORE U 
AND MAKE AN OBJTIVE DATABASE 
DECISION.  
      MOVING FOARD, WE WILL 
REVIEW AND CAN AMEND THE RATES 
USING THE REGULAR EXTERNAL 
EVALUATIONS INGRAINED IN THE 
EXISNG ORDINANCE.  THE REGULAR
EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS WILL TAKE 
PLACE 6 MONTHS FROM AND ANNUAY
ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE.  
      I'M GRATEFUL THAT THE 
EFFECTIVE DATE HAS ALREADY BEEN 
MOVED BACK TO JULY 1st.  THE 
EXTENSION WILL GE THE MARKET 
TIMING TO ADAPT AND WILL GIVE US
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE FAIR
AND FLEXIBLE MARKET OR AT LEAST 
A START OF BUILDING THAT MARKET 
WITH HEALTHY COMPETITION AND 
GOOD FAITH PARTNERS.  I'VE BEEN 
LEADING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS 
WITH DOWNTOWN PARTNERS ON 
STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE MARKET 
ACCESSIBILITY, BOOST ENTRY AND 
USE FOR NEW COMPANIES AND 
SUPPORT DRIVERS IN THIS 
TRANSITIONAG PERIOD.  
      THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDING
GRANT PROGRS ADVERTISING 
SUPPORT FOR NEW COMPANIES AND 
WORKSHOPS FOR NEW DRIVERS.  
TODAY I URGE MY FELLOW 
COLLEAGUES TO CONSIDER THIS 
AMOUNT THAT IS BOTH CENTERED IN 
OUR INTENTIONS AND BASED ON OUR 
CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA.  THE 
ONLY SUBSTANTIAL DATA WE AT THE 
CITY AND THE STATE HAS RIGHT 
NOW.  THANK YOUOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER KOSKI HAS 
MOVED THAT AMENDMENT.  IS THERE 
A SECOND EBB?
>> SECOND.  -- IS THERE A 
SECOND.  
>>ECOND.  I WILL CALL ON 
COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS.  
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND 
I JUST WANANT TO URGE MY Y 
COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS 
AMENDMENT THAT INCORPORATES THE 
RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON 
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BY THE STATE
OF MINNESOTA.  THEY OFFERED A 
RANGE AND THIS AMENDMENT IS AT 
THE TOP OF THAT RANGE SO IT 
INCLUDES THE PROTECTIONS AROUND 
WOR
WORKERS, SICK AND SAVE TIME, 
VACATION TIME, HEALTHCARE A 
OTHER K KINDS OF EXPENSES THAT 
WORKERS MAY INCUR AND, AGAIN, I 
WOULD JUST ENCOURA MY 
COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS 
AMENDMENT THAT IS BASED ON THE 
DATA IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY.  
THANK YOU.  
>> THANK YOU, COUNCILIL MEMBER 
JENKINS.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
CASHMAN?
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAYNE.  
      I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE
NOW EXTENDED THE IMPLEMENTATION 
DATE OF OUR ORDINANCE TT WE 
CAN CONTINUE HAVING 
CONVERSATIONS AUT RATE A AND 
JUST REGARDING DATA, I WANT TO 
THANK COUNCIL MEMBER CHOUDHURY 
FOR SETTING UP BRIEFINGS WITH 
THE STATE TEAM COUNCIL MEMBER TO
LEARN ABOUT THE PROCESS OF THE 
THODOLOGY BEHIND THEIR DATA 
AND WHAT IT REVEALS TOS.  
      AND ONE THING I WANT TO 
JUST CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC AND 
FOR MEDIA IS THAT WE HAVE NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DATA 
WITHOUT DOING A LISLATIVE 
PROCESS.  UBER AND LYFT HAVE 
BEEN VERY RELUCTANTNT TO ACTUAL 
PROVIDE DAT TO THE CITY OR TO 
THE STATE AND IT'S ONLY BECAUSE 
OF THE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT 
WE'VE TAKING OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT THEY HAVE 
SHOWN US ANY DATA TO CONTINUE TO
INFORMRM OUR POLICIES.  AND I 
THINK RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE 
DATA ON D DRIVERS FROM 2022.  
THAT'S WHAT THE STUDY INFORMED. 
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE DATA 
ON RIDERS.  
      COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO 
ACTUALLY SPOKE TO WHERE FOLKS 
ARE USING THE RIDE-SHARE 
SERVICES TO GET TO AND I ALSO 
SAW SOME DATA THAT LYFT PUT OUT 
ON SOCOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT DOWNTOW 
VENUE IN MY WARD BEING SOME OF 
THE TOP DESTINATIONS BUT THIS IS
REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
THATE SHOULD HAVE.  
      SO AS WE CONTINUE TO 
REFINE OUR POLICY, LET'S FIND 
WAYS TO -- TO GET THAT DATA FROM
IT RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES AND FROM
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND FROM
OUR CITY STAFF HE AT THE 
COMMUNITY PLANNING AND ECONOC 
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO 
CONTINUE TO HAVE A DATA INFORMED
POLICY BECAUSE WE REALLY DO NEED
THAT.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER WONSNSLEY?
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL PRESIDENT 
PAYNE.  
      SO I WILL NOT BE 
SUPPORTING THIS MOTION.  I HAVE 
BEEN CONSISTENT THAT IF NEW AND 
ADDITIONALNFORMATION CAME 
FORWARD THAT WOULD CHALLENGE THE
FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT RATES 
THAT WERE PASSED BY COCOUNCIL,  
WOULD HAPPILY BRING THE 
AMAMENDMENT MYSELF.  TO REFLECT 
THOSE RECOMMENDED CHANGES.  
BEC 
EARLIER ALL OF OUR POLICIES 
SHOULD BE ROOTED IN FACTUAL 
DATA, NOT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. 
        I ALSO HAVE NO INTERESTN
CHANGING THESE RATES BASED ON 
CORPORATE PRESSURE.  THE SAME 
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO
COUNCIL ON MARCH 14TH WHEN WE 
VOTED TO OVERRIDE THE MAYOR'S 
VETO IS THE SAME INFORMATION 
THAT WE HAVE TODAY.  
      THAT SAID, I WANT TO MAKE 
IT CLEAR FOR THE PUBLIC THAT 
THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW 
INFORMATION PROVIDED TO COUNCIL 
MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THE RATE 
AMENDMENT BEFORE US.  
    THE ONLY THING THAT MAY 
HAVE CHANGED IS THAT, YES, 
COUNL MEMBERS ARE FEELING 
PRESSURE TO GO BACK ON THEIR 
VOTES TO SUPPORT SUBMINIMUM 
WAGES.  
      I ALSO WANT TO NOTE IT'S 
REALLY IMPORTANT TOO THAT NONE 
 
EXPANDING RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES 
MING TO MINNEAPOLIS HAVE 
RAISED ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
RATES THAT WE PASSED.  IN FACT, 
THEY ARE COMING TO MINNEAPOLIS 
ININ RESPONSE TO COUNCIL PASSIN 
THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE THA PUT 
THE RATES AT 1.40 PER MILE AND 
THEN 51 CENTS PER MINUTE.  
      THE 1.21 RATE COMPENSATION
THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO 
CONSIDER TODAY IS REFLECTIVE OF 
THE DLI'S ANALYS OF THE 
7-UNTY METRO AREA WCH 
INCLUDES PLACES LIKE CHASKA AND 
NORTHFIELD AND I DON'T THINK I 
NEED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE COST OF 
DOINING BUSINESS IN MINNEAPOLISS
DIFFERENT THAN IT IS IN PLACES 
LIKE DAKOTA COUNTY OR CARVER 
COUNTY.  THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW 
INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATES 
OUR CURRENT RATES ARE INCORRECT.
SO I WILL NOT B SUPPORTING THIS
AMENDMENT AND CONTINUE TO STAND 
WITH WHAT WE PASSED ORIGINALLY. 
>> COUNCIL MEMBER CHOUDHURY?
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAYNE.  
      SO I WILL JUST START OFF 
BY SAYING I AM UNABLE TO SPORT
THESE COMPENSATION RATES AT THIS
TIME IN THIS MEETI TODAY.  I 
ALSO JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND 
TO KIND OF CLARIFY FOR THE 
PUBL 
SOMETHING SAID ABOUT THE DEBATE 
THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST ITHE 
RANGE OF 81 CENTS TO 1.21.  
WHILE THAT IS THE RANGE PROVIDED
IN THE DLI STUDY AND IN THAT 
RANGE THERE'S STE LEGISLATURES
THAT ARE CALLING FOR RATES 
HIGHER THAN 1.21.  I JUST WANT 
 
OCCURRING AT THE DEBATE IS OUT 
OF THAT RANGE SO IT'S NOT JUST 
SET AT 89 C CENTS TO 1.21.  
      WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE
WHERE WE WILL BE HEARING FROM 
OUR POLICY AND RESEARCH TEAM,
AND I DISAGREE THAT IT'NOT 
WORTH HEARING FROM THEM AS 
THEY'RE WORKING ON ANALYSIS TO 
BE PROVIDING CONSIDERATION OF 
THE STATE STUDY AND ONE OF THE 
ASKS FOR ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
INCLUDING MYSELF IS LET'S 
CONSIDER THE STATE STUDY AND WE 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO -- WE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK 
THROUGH THIS WAY AND PAR WILL BE
COMPLETING THEIR ANALYSIS NEXT 
WEEK AND I HOPE THIS BODY CAN 
WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE A 
PRESENTATION OF IT WHERE WE CAN 
ALL BE A PART OF IT.  AND WHILE 
A UNIVERSALLY ADAED CORRECT 
PER MILE COMPENSATION RATE DATA 
POINT OR RANGE MAY N BE 
PROVIDED, WE WIWILL BE PROVIDED 
WITH ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS TO 
FACILITATE THIS DISCUSSION ON 
THIS SUBJECT.  AND I MADE A 
PUBLIC COMMITMENT IF THERE WAS 
ADDITIONAL DATA AND INFORMATION 
TH I COULD CONSIDER, I WOULD 
THOUGHTFULLY BE WILLING TO MAKE 
CHANGES AS LONG AS -- AS LONG AS
IT WAS ABOUT ACHIEVING OUR GOAL 
OF A FAIR MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE 
CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS FOR TNC 
DRIVERS.  NOT BECAUSE OF 
CORPORATE PRESSURE, NOT BECAUSE 
 POLITICS BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE 
NEW INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US 
AND I'M OPEN AND READY TO 
CONSNSIDER IT AND, UNFORTUNATEL 
THE TIMELINE OF PASSING A 
COMPENSATION RATE DOESN'T LINE 
UP -- THE TIMELINE TODAY TO
PASSION THIS COMPENSATATION RAT 
DOESN'T -- PASS THIS 
COMPENSATION RATE DOES NOT LINE 
UP WITH US GETTING THE 
INFORMATION AND THE PROCESS OF 
ACTUALLY GETTING - ACTUALLY 
GETTG TO USE THAT AS AN 
INFORMED WAY OF HAVIN A 
DISCUSSION SO I'M REALLY GLAD 
THAT WE HAVE MORE TIME FOR OUR 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO DO THAT. 
>> COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW?
>> THANKNK YOU, CHAIR PAYNE.  I 
JUST WANTED TO JUST KIND OF 
CLEAR SOMETHING UP BECAUSE THERE
WAS A COMMENT MADE BY 
COUNCIL MEMBERING CASHMAN ABOUT 
UBER -- COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN 
ABOUT UBERING AND LYFT NOT 
PROVIDING MINIMUM WAGE.  WE HAD 
INFORMATION BACK FROM CITY STAFF
BECAUSE THERE WAS A LEGISLATIVE 
DIRECTIVE AND OUR STAFF USED 
THAT INFORMATION FROM OTHER 
CITIES TO PRESENT TO THE COUNCIL
TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  THEY 
NEVER REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM
US.  I DON'T THINK AS OF NOW 
CI 
INFORMATION FROM IT UBER AND 
LYFT OR H HAS EVEN MET WITH UBE 
AND LYFT.  I KNOW THERE WAS AN 
EMAIL EXCHANGE FROM OUT OF MY 
OFFICE ABOUT A MONTH AGO.  HAVE 
YOU MET WITH UBER AND LYFT?
HAVE THEY SAID NO TO GIVI YOU 
INFORMATION AND STAFF HERET 
THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID, NO
WE HAVEN'T MET WITH THEM AND NO 
WE HAVE NOT REQUESTED THE 
INFORMATION.  WE'RE GOING TO 
WAIT FOR THE STATE REQUEST SO I 
CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT, YOU
KNOW,, SPEAKING TO -- IF STAFF 
HASN'T RECEIVED SOMETHI -- IF 
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR IT, WHY 
WOULD THEY REIVE IT?
>> COUNCIL MEMBER CASHMAN?
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAYNE.  
I FORGOT TO MENTION IN MY 
EARLIER COMMENTS THAT I WILL BE 
SUORTING THIS COMPENSATION 
CHANGE TODAY BASED ON THE DATA 
THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US.  
THE DLI STUDY WHICH WE CAN'T 
CONFIRM AT THIS TIME THAT WE 
WILL HAVE ANY NEW DATA COMING 
FORWARD WHICH IS WHY I MENTIONED
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO 
CREATE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE DATA
TRANSPARENCY FROM THE COMPANIES 
WHO ARE LICENSED AND OPERATING 
IN OUR CITY.  BUT I'M WILLING TO
SUPPORT THE COMPENSATION RATES 
THAT COUNCIL MEMBER KOSKI AND 
COCOUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS BROUGH 
FORWARD TODAY BASED ON THE DLI 
STUDY.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER OSMAN 
>> THANK Y YOU, COUNCIL PRESIDE.
I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS 
T I DO WANT TO MENTION TO YOU 
AND SHARE THE STORY OF HOW UBER 
AND LYFT ARE NOT JUST DRIVERS 
AND RIDERS TOO.  YESTERDAY WAS A
ISLAMIC HOLIDAY.  MLIM DRIVERS
THE MAJORITY THAT DRIVER IN THE 
TWIN CITIES CITY HAVE LOGGED OUT
YESTERDAY AROUND 8:0000, 7:00 I 
THE MORNING TO GO PRAY AND SPEND
TIME WITH THEIR FAMILY WELL, 
THAT MEANS THERE WAS LESS 
DRIVEE
SCREENSHOTS THAT UBER AND LYFT 
WERE HIKING THE PRICE FOR 
7-MINUTE TRIP.  THEY WERERE 
CHARGING CUSTOMERS, DISABLED OR 
NONDISABLED OR ANYBODY WHO 
REQUESTED $76 OR $80 FOR 
7-MINUTE TRIP.  SO THEY'RE NOT 
EXPLOIOITING DRIVERS AND PAYING 
LESS BUT THEY'RE AO EXPLOITING
RIDERS.  
(APPLAUSE.) 
>> LESS THAN A MILILE.  LESS TH 
A MILE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE 
THOSE SCREENSHOTS RIGHT HERE.  
$70.  WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT 
THAT?
I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH 
YOU.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE?
>> THANK YOU --
(TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY.) 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
(APPLAUSE.) 
>> PLEASE, WE NEED TO CONDUCT 
OUR BUSINESS.  PLEASE HOLD YOUO 
COMMENTS.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
RAINVILLE?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  
IT'S VERY CLEAR WE HAVE A 
DIVIDED COUNCIL ON THIS AND WE 
NEED MORE DISCUSSION BUT I WOULD
JUST ASK AS WE GO FORWARD TO 
COUNCIL 
COUNCIL MEMBER VETAW'S POINT.  
LET'S INCLUDE UBER AND LYFT.  
LET'S INCLUDE THE NEW RIDE-SHARE
DRIVERS AND HOWEVER OUR STAFF 
WAS VERY SMART AND BRILLIANT CAN
FIGURE OUT -- LET'S GETNPUT 
FROM THE USERS.  THAT'S THE 
EMAILS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN 
GETTING IS THE PANIC AND THE 
TRAUMA THAT IS BEING CAUSESED B 
THE USERS SO LET'S INCLUDE 
EVERYBODY AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  
THANK YOU.  
>> COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANO?
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.  I 
CAN'T SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO 
THIS WITHOUT ALSO POINTING OUT 
THAT THIS -- THIS RATE ISN'T 
WITHIN THE RANGE O OF THE STATE 
STUDY.  ONE OF THE NUMBERS OF 
THE OTHER IS NOT.  AND I ALSO 
NEED TO POINT OUT, AGAIN, HOW 
MUCH THE STATE STUDY IS ALREADY 
WEIGHTED TO DRIVERS.  I LEARNED 
THAT MORE AND MORE IN OUR 
BRIEFING WITH THE MMISSIONER 
HERSELF.  AND THE WAY THESE 
CALCULATIONS WORK -- IF WE HAD 
CITY-LEVEL DATA WHICH IS CLEAR 
WE WILL NOT BE GETTING FROM THE 
STATE AND HAS BEEN CLEAR FOR 
MANY WEEKS, AS CONFIRMED BY THE 
COMMISISSIONER, THE RATES HERE  
THE CITY WOULD GO DOWN.  THEY 
DOWN.  SO I JUST NEEDED TO POINT
OUTT THAT AT THE LOW END OF THE
STATE STUDY, THAT INCLUDE 
MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL PARTS OF A 
TRIP, BOTH A DRIVER WAITING TO 
SEE RIDERS THAT MIGHT BE IN 
QUEUE AND ACCEPTOUR RIDE, BOTH
THE DRIVER DRIVING TO PICK UP 
THE PASSENGER AND THEN WHEN THE 
TIME THAT THE RIDER IS IN THE 
BACK OF THEIR CAR.  THAT -- THAT
89 CENTS PER MILE RATE INCLUDES 
VEHICLE ACQUISITION, NOT FOR 
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE A CAR 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT F 
UBER OR LYFT.  IT INCLUDES 
VEHICLE QUISITION.  IT 
INCLUDES THE GAS.  THE 
INSURANCE, A MOBILE PHONE, 
MAINTENANCE, CLEING COSTS -- 
ALL CLEANING COSTS AND 
ALLEGATION AND REGISTRATION.  
      AT THE TOP OF THIS RANGE, 
THE 1.21 RATE WHICH THAT RATE IS
BEING PROPOSED HERE IN THIS 
MOTION -- IT JUST DOESN HAVE 
THE OTHER ELEMENTS -- IT 
INCLUDES THINGS THAT MOST 
PART-TIME WORKERS IN OUR CITY DO
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO.  IT INCLUDES
SICK TIME, PAID LEAVE, HEALTH 
INSURANCE, RETIREMENT SAVINGS 
AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.  ALL
OF THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTRTANT 
ALL OF THESE THINGS SHOULD BE 
AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.  BUT FOR
PART-TIME WORKERS, THEY 
GENERALLY DON'T HAVE THIS AND 
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THIS IS 
USUALLY SOMETHING THEY NEED TO 
CALCULATE DIFFERENTLY.  
      EVERY DRIVER FOR TNC CAN 
DEDUCT 67 CENTS PER MILE WHICH 
ENDS UP BEING AN AVERAGE, I 
LEARNED FROM THE COMMISSIONER, 
OF $23,400 A YEAR R ON THEIR 
INCOME.  THAT'S NOT A TAX 
CREDIT. HAT'S AN INCOME CREDIT
AND THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR
DRIVERS  CONTINUE T TO BE 
ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER KINDS OF 
ENTITLEMENTS THAT THE STATE 
PROVIDES, LIKE, MNSURE AND OTHER
KINDS OFOF PROGRAMS.  SO I JUST 
NEEDED TO CALL OUT THE FACTS 
HERE AND WHAT THE RATES ARE HERE
IN THIS MOTION BECAUSE I WON'T 
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THIS 
MORNING.  THANK YOU.  
>> I PUT MYSELF INTO QUEUE 
'CAUSE I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON
A COUPLE OFFING THE 
COMPLEXITY -- COUPLE OFFING THE 
COMPLEXES -- COUPLE OF THE 
COMPLEXITIES OF THE 
CONVERSATIONON.  IT IS LEVEL OF 
COMPLEXITIES THERE'S NEVER GOING
TO TO BE ONE N NUMBER THAT 
CAPTURES THEOTALITY OF THE 
DYNAMICS HE OF THIS MARKETPLACE.
THIS MARKETPLACE IS INHERENTLY 
DYNAMIC SO THAT MEANS ON ANY 
GIVEN RIDE, OR FOR ANY GIVEN 
DRIVER IT, THEIR EXPENSES ARE 
GOING TO BE DIFIFFERENT THAN 
ANOTHER DRIVER BUT THEN ALSO ON 
ANY GIVEN SHIFT IT'S GOING TO BE
DIFFERENT.  
      THE DYNAMIC THAT 
COUNCIL MEMBER PALMISANOS 
REFERENCING IS AROUND THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRIVING IN 
THE INNERORE OF THE CITY 
VERSUS IN THE SUBURBS.  THE 
HIGHER DENSITY IS GOING TO LEAD 
TO YOU HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT 
SHIFT GOING FROM ONE RIDER TO 
THE NEXT SO THE P3 OR THE TIMING
OF AN ACTIVE RIDER WILL BE 
HIGHER SHARE OF YOUR TIME ON 
SHIFT.  BUT IFF YOU'RE DOING MOE
TRIPS TO THE AIRPORT, IT'S GOING
TO -- YOU'RE GOING TO BE SITTING
AND WAITING LONGER FOR THOSE 
TRIPS SO EVEN ON A P TRIP 
BASIS, THE RATE IS GOING TO BE 
FFERENT.  THERE'S NOT A 
TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE WAY TO 
CALCULATE REAL TIME EXPENSE 
RATES ON A PER TRIP BASIS.  
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTNTAL PROBLE 
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS 
HERE SO WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY
WHAT IS A REASONABLE NUMBER THAT
WILLLL ALLOW FOR THE MAJORITY O 
THESE SCERIOS TO ACHIEVE A 
MINIMUM WAGE?
THISIS, WHAT, COUNCIL MEMBER 
WONSLEY IS REALLY HIGHLIGHTING 
THE 1.40 RATE.  ALTHOUGH THE DLI
RATE IS CLEAR  CENTS A KEYWORD
ON AVERAGE YOU CAN ACHIEVE A 
MINIMUM WAGE ON AVERAGE.  THAT'S
NOT GOING TO BE A GUARANTEED 
MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE MAJITY OF
THOSE TRIPS.  BAUSE THERE'S SO
MUCH DYNAMIC CHANGE ON A 
PER-TRIP BASIS.  THAT'S WHY YOU 
HAVE A LOT OF DRIVERS HERE IF 
YOU'RE TO SUPPORT THIS POLICY 
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A LOT OF 
DRIVERS HERE AGAINST THIS 
POLICY.  BECAUSE DEPENDING ON 
WHAT KIND OF DRIVING YOU DO, YOU
ARE GOING TO END UP WITH WILDLY 
DIDIFFERENT RATES AND SO THERE E
PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING PRETTY WELL
AS DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY
PICKING AND CHOOSING TRIPS THAT 
WORK FOR TM AND IT'S 
MAXIMIZING THEIR RATES AND THEN 
THERE ARE OTHER DRIVERS WHO ARE 
DOING WAY MORE TYPES OF TRIPS, 
WAY MORE DIVERSITY OF TRIPS, 
LESS SELTIVE IN THEIR TRIPS 
AND THEIR RATE -- THEY'RE 
GETTING EXPLOITED IN A DIFFERENT
WAY.  AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO 
IDENTIFY A WAY TO CAPTURE THE 
MOST REASONABLE SCENARIO TO 
ESTABLISH A MINIMUM WAGE AND 
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE
THAT WE'RE FACED WITH HERE AND 
SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIHIS 
MOTION TODAY BECAUSE OUR STAFF 
IS REALLY DIGGING INTO THOSE 
DYNAMICS RIGHT N AND WE'RE 
ONLY ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE 
DIVERSITY OF EXPENSES THAT IT 
DRIVERS INCUR WHETHER T THEY'RE 
DRIVING A BRAND-NEW HIGH-END 
VEHICLE , YOU KNOW, A MORE 
ECONOMICAL OLDER MODEL VEHICLE. 
THAT'S THE ONLY VARIABILITY THAT
OUR STAFF ARE LOOKING INTO RIGHT
W.  THEY'RE NOT LOOKING INTO 
THE DIVERSITY OF TRIPS WHEN I 
COMES TO THE ACTIVE RIDER TIME 
AND WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE 
WITH THE VARIANCE ON THAT AND, 
AGAIN, TO COUNCIL MEMBER 
PALMISANO'S POINT, IF YOU HAVE A
RIDER IN YOUR CAR FOR THE 
TOTALITY OF THE HOUR, THAT RATE 
WOULD GO DOWN BUT WE HAVE TO 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU'RE 
NOGOING TO HAVE A RIDER IN 
YOUR CAR 100% OF THE TIME.  AND 
SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS WHOLE 
CONVERSATION COMPLEX.  THAT'S 
WHY OUR STAFF ARE LOOKING INTO 
THE DLI REPORT.  I'M NOT 
CAUTIONING THE ACCURACY OF THE 
DLI REPORT.  I'M LOOKING AT THE 
INHERENT NATURE THAT IT IS A 
SCENARIOS THAT LEADS TO MULTIPLE
TCOMES AND WE ARE TRYING TO 
TARGET A POLICY THAT ELIMINATES 
THE MOST EGREGIOUS OUTCOME WHERE
DRIVERS ARE GETTING EXPLOITED TO
THE MAXIMUM SO THAT'S WHAT THE 
PURPOSE OF THIS IS.  THIS IS WHY
WE DID A TIME EXTENSION SO WE 
CAN DIG INTO THAT COMPLEXITY, 
ACCOUNT FOR IT BOTH IN OUR CITY 
POMONA AND MAKE SURE -- POLICY 
AND MAKE SURE OUR ACCOUNTING 
PARTNERS ARE ACCOUNTING FOR IT 
SO THE DRIVERS OF MINNESOTA ARE 
PROTECTED.  SO THOSE ARE THE 
ONLY REMARKS I'M WANTING TO 
SHARE.  I'M CHECKING IN THE 
QUEUE TO SEE IF ANYBODY IS LEFT.
I SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION SO 
I'D ASK THE CLERK TO CALL THE 
ROLL.  
(ROLL CALL.) 
>> THERE ARE 3 AYES AND 10 NAYS.
>> THAT MOTION FAILS.  AND ARE 
AMENDMENTS?THER FURTHER 
SEEING NO OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS 
IN QUEUE, WE HAVE NOW ADOPTED 
THE MOTION TO EXTEND THE 
IMPLEM,
NO OTHER MOTIONS PASSED AND SO  
THAT CARRIES AND THE ORDINANCE 
IS A ADOPTED FOR THE MAYOR'S 
CONSIDERATION.  
      COLLEAGUES, THE NEXT ORDER
OF BUSINESS IS NOTICE OF 
ORDINANCE INTRODUCTIONS AND WE 
HAVE ONE ITEM TODAY WHICH ALSO 
PERTAINS TO TRANSPORTATION 
NETWORK COMPANIES.  THIS IS A 
NOTICE FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS 
WONSLEY, CHAVEZ AND OSMAN TO 
INTRODUCE AT THE NEXT REGULAR 
MEETING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF AN
ORDINANCE THAT AMENDS PROVISIONS
RELATED TO RATES AND THE 
ENFORCEMENT OF MINIMUM 
COMPENSATION.  FOR CONTEXT, IT'S
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 
AMENDMENTS TO THE ORDINANCE THAT
WE JUST MODIFIED BUT THAT THESE 
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD INTRODUCE 
NEW CONTENT -- THESE ARE 
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD INTRODUCE 
NEW CONTENT S SO, THEREFORE, AR 
FOLLOWING THE STANDARD 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.  TO BRING 
THOSE CHANGES FORWARD I'M HAPPY 
TO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORS TO 
SPEAK TO THEIR NOTICE AND THE 
GENERAL N NATURE OF THEIR PROPOD
AMENDMENTS.  IS THERE ANY IN 
QUEUE?
IS IT COUNCI
>> -- COUNCIL MEMBER WONSLEY. ?
>> I COUNCIL MEMBERS CHAVEZ AND 
OSMAN WERE GIVEN NOTICE TO 
INCLUDE TWO NEW PROVISIONS THAT 
WERE CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL 
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ORDINANCE.  
LAST MONTH SEVERAL COUNCIL 
MEMBERS BROUGHT FORWARD 
AMENDMENTS THAT MANDATED 
CONTINUOUS AND ONGOING 
EVALUATION.  
>> EUSE ME, COUNCIL PRESIDENT 
PAYNE, COULD WE CLEARHE 
CHAMBERS HERE?
>> YES, FOLKS AS YOU MAKE YOUR 
WAY OUT OF THE CHAMR, CAN YOU 
PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICES SILENT? 
(PAUSE.) 
>> WE'LL JUST GIVE IT A MINUTE, 
IF THAT'S OKAY, COUNCIL MEMBER 
WONSLEY?
(PAUSE.) 
>> OKAY.  COUNCIL MEMBER 
WONSLEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
PROCEED?
>> ALL RIGHT, SECOND TAKE.  
      SO BASICALLY LAST MOH 
SEVERAL COUNCIL MEMBERS BROUGHT 
FORWARDMENDMENTS TO THE 
ORDINANCE THAT MANDATES ONGOING 
EVALUATION.  IN LIGHT OF THAT, 
THE PROVISIONS THAT WE'RE 
BRINGINGORWARD WILL BE 
NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY HONOR 
THOSOSE AMENDMENTS BUT ALSO ENSE
SUCCESSFUL AND ACCURATE 
EVALUATION OF THE ORDINANCE.  AS
YOU HIGHLIGHTED COUNCIL 
PRESIDENT PAYNE, THESE ORDINANCE
WILL START THROUGH THE PROCESS 
STARTING TODAY AND SHOULD BE 
TAKEN UP BY COUNCIL FOR A FULL 
ADOPTION VOTE IN LATE MAY.  
      THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS 
GIVE US AMPLE TIME FOR OUR  
COLLEAGUES AND THE PUBLIC TO 
CONSIDERER THE LANGUAGE WHICH 
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE LIMS 
FILINGITH THIS BUT I'LL SHARE 
A BRIEF HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW OF 
WHAT THEY ARE.  
      SO THE FIRST PROVISION IS 
AROUND FAIR TRANSPARENCY.  THIS 
PROVISION WILL MANDATE THAT ALL 
RIDE-SHARE COMPANI SEND 
RECEIPTS TO BOTH RIDERS AND 
DRIVERS DETAILING HOW MUCH T 
RIDER WAS CHARGED, HOW MUCH THE 
DRIVER WAS PAID, THE DISTANCE 
AND DURATION OF THE RIDE AND 
OTHER BASIC DETAILS.  THIS 
SURES THAT THE DRIVERS AND THE
RIDERS AREBLE TO IDENTIFIFY 
POSSIBLE WAGE THEFT OR OTHER 
COMPENSATION VIOLATIONS AND 
BRING FORWARD COMPLAINTS TO 
ADDRESS THEM.  
      ALSO IN OUR PREVIOUS 
CONVERSATION AROUND THE 
RECONSIDATION, I'M VERY HAPPY 
TO HEAR THAT EVERYONE HAVE A 
MORE MINNEAPOLIS-SPECIFIC DATA  
FROM THESE COMPANIES.  WE 
SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO BEG OR WAIT 
FOR THE STATE OR FOR THESE TNCS 
TO LIKE US TO SHARE IT.  SO THE 
SECOND PROVISION WE'RE GOING TO 
BRINGING FORWARD IS AROROUND DA 
DISCLOSURE.  THIS PROVISION
I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR REGULAR
AND UNRESTRICTED DATA IS CRUCIAL
FOR THE COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF 
TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS AN ENFORCE 
THE ORDINANCE.
THIS AMENDMENT WOULD GUARANTEE 
THE CITY DIRECT ACCESS, 
COMPREHENSIVE MINNEAPOLIS 
SPECIFIC DAT GOING FORWARD.
AND THOSE ARE THE HIGH-LEVEL 
OVERVIEWS.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEM IN THE 
COMING WEEKS.
>>  SEEING NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE,
TH THAT, NOTICE IS GIVEN AND 
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED 
TODAY.
THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS 
FINISHED ITS BUSINESS ADDRESSING
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES
FO THIS MEETING.
THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS IS 
RESOLUTIONS, AS SHOWN ON THE 
AGAGENDA WE HAVE THREE HONORARY 
RESOLUTIONS TODAY.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR 
COMMENTS FROROM COUNCIL MBERS ON
ANY OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS?
COUNCIL MEMBER JENKINS.
>>  THANK YOU, PSIDENT PAYNE.
I WANT TO COMMENT ON ALL THREE 
OF THE RESOLUTIONS AND THANK MY 
COLLEAGUES FOR PASSING THESE.
THE FIRST HONORARY RESOLUTION, 
HONORING CAMILLE GAUGE -- GAGE, 
WAS PASSED A FEW MONTHS AGO.
SHE WAS A PROMINENT MEMBER IN 
OUR COMMUNITY, WORKING WITH 
PEOPLE OF COLOR, PARTICULARLY IN
THE INDIGENOUS NATIVE AMERICAN 
COMMUNITIES, A LOCAL ARTIST, 
FEMINIST.
SHE WAS A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE 
FIRST ALL-FEMALE BANDS AND WE 
GOT A REQUEST FROM SOME OF THE 
MEMBERS OF THE BAND TO CORRECT 
SOME OF E INFORMAON WE HAD 
IN THE -- RESOLUTION.
IT WAS ESSENTILY JUST A 
CORRECTION.
BUT THANK YOU, COLLEAGUES, FOR 
SUPPORTING THAT.
AND THEN CERTAINLY, THE 50-YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY -- I AN, WE TALALKED
ABOUT THAT EXTENSIVELY THIS 
MORNING.
AND I, AGAIN, WANT TO JUST 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE CITY OF 
MINNEAPOLIS LEADING THE NATION 
IN THE RECOGNITION OF LGBTQ AND 
PARTICULARLY TRANSGENDER RIGHTS 
AND THIS BODY HAS BEEN VERY 
ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THAT AS 
WELL.
AND THEN LASTLY, THERE IS 
HONORARY RESOLUTION HONORING MS.
ADRIENNE RATLIFF, WHO WAS A 
HONORARY M MEMBER IN DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS, SMALL D.
HER SISTER WAS THE PARK BOARD 
SUPERINTENDENT FOR MANY, MANY 
YEARS.
MS. MARY MERRILL AND HER NEPHEW 
WAS STATE SENATOR JEFF HAYDEN.
AND SO JUST WANT TO THANK MY 
COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING THIS 
RESOLUTION TODAY AND MS. 
RATCLIFF, MAY SHE REST IN PEACE,
WAS A VERY, VERY ACTIVE AND 
PROMINENT MEMBER OF OUR 
COUNITY.
THANK YOU.
>>  THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
JENKINS.
COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I, TOO, WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY 
GRATITUDE FOR MY COLLEAGUES FOR 
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
CIVIL RIGHTS ORDINANCE.
I WANT TO THANK LEE WHO BROUGHT 
THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND 
PATRICK SADLER FROM MY OFFICE, 
WHO WAS GREAT WORDSMITH.
COUNCIL MEMBER KOSKI AND HER 
OFFICE, THANK YOU FOR GRABBING 
THE BALL AND TAKINGG THE LEAD O 
THIS.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TWO 
REASONS.
ONE, TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE STAND 
ON THE SHOULDERS OF SOME REALLY 
GREAT COUNCIL MEMBERS.
AND WE SAW THEM TODAY.
 YEARS IS A LONG TIME.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US 50 YEARS 
FRFROM NOW.
HOPEFULLY WE C GET TOGETHER 
AND LAUGH AND SIT IN THE BACK 
ROOM AND BE FRIENDS.
AND THERE WERE SOME THAT WEREN'T
ABLE TO CE TODAY.
>>  [OFF MIC]. 
[L
[LAUGHTER]. 
>>  I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, 
WE DO HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS 
DEPARTMENT ANDND HR DEPARTMENT.
SO LEAVE ME ALONE.
[LAUGHTER]. 
IF I MAY CONTINUE.
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAVE 
FRIENDS.
THANK YOU.
IN PARTICULAR, THERE ARE SEVERAL
THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO COME AND 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT MARS WAS 
UNABLE TOOME TODAY AND THERE 
WAS A YOUNG DYNAMIC CNCIL 
MEMBER FROM THE FOURTH WARD, THE
RST DEMOCRAT EVER ELECTED IN 
THEE FOURTH WARD, JOHN DARIS, 
WHOSE HEALTH PREVENTED HIM FROM 
TODAY.
AND I WANT TO CONCLUDE WITH 
BRINGING UP THE MEMORY OF 
BROTHER MICHAEL COLLINS WHO GREW
UP IN THE PROJECTS OF NORTH 
MINNEAPOLIS.
HE WASAS A DYNAMIC EDUCATOR AT  
LA SELLLE.
HE ALWAYS REMINDED US, IF YOU 
DON'T CELEBRATE SUCCESS IT NEVER
HAPPENS.
TODAY WE CELEBRATED SUCCESS AND 
I'M SO GRATEFUL TOY COLLEAGUES
FOR THAT UNANIMOUS VOTE.
>>  THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
RAINVILLE.
COUNCIL MEMBER JENKS.
>>  THANK YOU, PRESIDENT PAYNE.
I WANTED TO GET IN QUEUE.
COUNCIMEMBER RAINVILLE 
REMINDED ME I SHOULD REALLY HAVE
THANKED MY STAFF AS WELL, WHO 
REALLY WORKED HARD AND DIL
DILIGENTLY ON ALL THREE 
RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THE 
FORMAL CELEBRATION THAT WAS --  
THIS MORNING AS WELL.
AND I'M NOT SURE IF I'LL BE 
AROUND 50 YEARS FROM NOW,  
COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE, BUT I 
DO THINK SOME OF THE DECISIONS
THAT WE MAKE ON THIS BODY WILL  
STAND UP FOR 50 YEARS AND 
HOPEFULLY OUR PREDECESSORS WILL 
-- OR SUCCESSORS, I SHOULD SAY, 
WILL RECOGNIZE THOSE 
CONTRIBUTIONS.
>>  THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER 
JENKINS.
COUNCIL L MEMBER KOSKI.
>>  THANK YOU, PREDENT PAYNE.
I WILL JUST ADD A C COUPLE -- F 
MORE REMARKS IN GRATITUDE FOR A 
FEW OTOTHERS THAT HELPED OUT.
COUNCIL MEMBER CHOWDHURY'S TEAM.
ADAY HELPED US WITH A REALLY 
BEAUTIFUL GRAPHIC.
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD  EXAMPLE, 
TOO, WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER 
AND COLLABORATE, YOU KNOW, THEY 
CAME IN AND SAID, WELL, DO YOU 
HAVE AN INVITATION?
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS
COOL?
I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT SURE.
SHE WAS LIKE, I I'M ON IT.
GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
FOR -- AND PATRICK, FROM COUNCIL
MEMBER RAINVILLE'S TEAM, HE IS 
THE ONE WHO WROTE THE RESOLUTION
AND DID IT SO QUICKLY AND 
EL
ELEGANTLY.
I WILL SAY IN COUNCIL MEMBER 
PAYNE'S OFFICE, BEN WAS INTEGRAL
IN MAKING SURE WE WERE INVITING 
AND INCLUDING ALL OUR CITY STAFF
AND IT WAS REALLY IMPTANT AND 
THE WRITING OF THE RESOLUTION AS
WELL.
AND CHRISTINA, FROM COUNCIL 
MEMBER JEJENKINS' OFFICE, TOO, S
RIGHT ON IT, MAKING SURE WE WERE
GETTING THE INVITATION OUT.
AND FOR CURRENT -- FOR MY TEAM, 
WHO WAS REALLY THE GE TO GET 
EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND WE HAD 
MANY MEETINGS, SEVERAL SEVERAL 
MEETINGS WITH THE FORMER 
ALDERMAN AND THEY WERE LONG 
WINDED BECAUSE THEY REALLY LOVE 
TO TELL THE STORIES.
I'M SHOCKED -- NOT BECAUSE OF 
THEIR MEMORY -- BUT SOMETIMES I 
DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN REMEMBER A
MEETING THAT HAPPENED TWO WEEKS 
AGO AND THEY, IN VERY DISTINCT 
-- LIKE, COULD REMEMBER THE ROOM
AND WHAT THEY PRACTICALLY WERE 
WEARING AND THE EXACTLY WHAT
SOMEBODY SAID FROM 50 YEARS AGO 
IN THESE MEETINGS.
IT'S BEEN REALLY HEARTFTFELT ANI
WILL ALSO SAY BECOMING A COUNCIL
MEMBER, I GUESS ON THE SHOULDERS
OF MY FATHER, WHO WAS A COUNCIL 
MEMBER AND THEN MAYOR, I DIDN'T 
REALLY KNOW THATNY OF THE WORK
THAT WE DID WOULD EVER COINCIDE.
AND THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT IT -- YOU KNKNOW,, 
LIKE, COUNCIL MEMBER RAINVILLE 
SAID, ONE OF THE FORMER ALDERMAN
APPROACHED US AND I WAS REALLY 
GRATEFUL WE COULD CONTINUE TO 
CELEBRATE AND SUPPORT THE WORK 
THAT THOSE HAVE DONE BEFORE US.
IT WAS ALSO JUST REALLY AMAZING 
TO HAVE SO MANY TRAIL BLAZERS IN
HERE WITH US TODAY AND YOUTH, TO
BE ABLE TO SEE THAT OUR WORK IS 
NOT DONE.
AND IT IS JUST CONTINUING.
AND THIS MORNING, WE HAD A 
LOVELY BREAKFAST AND I WILL END 
WITH THIS.
